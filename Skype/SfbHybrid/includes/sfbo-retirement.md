[Skype for Business Online will be retired](/microsoftteams/skype-for-business-online-retirement) on July 31, 2021, at which point it will no longer be accessible. We encourage Skype for Business Online customers to start using Teams and begin planning their upgrades now to allow ample time to complete upgrade prior to the retirement date.
