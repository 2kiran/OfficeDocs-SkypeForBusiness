# Virtual consultations with Teams and the Bookings app for remote sales and service

## Overview

The [Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5) in Microsoft Teams streamlines and simplifies remote sales and service for financial services organizations. You can schedule and manage virtual consultations, enabling bank relationship managers, financial advisors, and claims adjusters, just to name a few, to serve your customers with increased efficiency and convenience.

The Bookings app makes it easy to manage complex scheduling demands across your organization. Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well as communications with internal and external attendees, from a single experience.

Virtual consultations are held through Microsoft Teams meetings, which offers robust videoconferencing capabilities. For example, a banking advisor can share their screen and request electronic signatures on documents, allowing them to close transactions remotely.

Each virtual appointment includes a Teams meeting link that’s sent to attendees in email where they can easily join from a web browser or in Teams on any device. Automated email reminders help reduce no-shows and enhance customer engagement.

This article gives you an overview of how to use the Bookings app in Teams to deliver remote sales and service.

## Before you get started

If you’re an admin, see [Manage the Bookings app in Teams](bookings-app-admin.md) to learn about the prerequisites for using the Bookings app in Teams, how to control access to Bookings in your organization, and recommended policy and admin settings.

Remember that only schedulers in your organization need to have the Bookings app installed in Teams. Staff who conduct or participate in virtual appointments don't need the app. They join appointments from their Teams or Outlook calendar or by using the meeting link in their booking confirmation email.

## Set up a new booking calendar

### Create the booking calendar

In Teams, go to **Bookings** > **Get started**, and then select **New booking calendar**. Complete the form and be sure to choose **Financial services** for the business type.

If you’re a larger organization, consider creating more than one booking calendar if you want customers to receive a booking email from a specific department rather than your overall organization. 
To learn more, see [Create a Bookings calendar](https://support.microsoft.com//office/create-a-bookings-calendar-921cfd26-a24d-4aca-9004-561594112148).

> [!NOTE]
> If this isn't your first time in the Bookings app or if you want to work in an existing booking calendar, in Bookings, select the dropdown arrow next to your business name, and then choose **Existing booking calendar**. From here, you can search for the one you want.

### Add staff

In the booking calendar, go to **More options** (...) > **Settings**, and then select **Staff**. Add staff members and assign a role to each person you add.

The Bookings app integrates with Outlook. After you add staff, you’ll be able to view that person’s calendar availability and schedule bookings for them. To learn more, see [Add staff and view a Bookings calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-staff-and-view-a-bookings-calendar-6c579f61-8adb-4514-9458-021de2023fa0).  

### Create appointment types

Create specific appointment types to represent the services offered by your organization and to tailor the booking experience.

In the booking calendar, go to **More options** (...) > **Appointment types**, and then select **New appointment type**. Enter a name&mdash;for example, Account opening, Loan consultation, Tax preparation&mdash;and any other information and settings you want.

The information and links that you add are included in the email conformation that's sent to customers every time this type of appointment is booked. You can even set email reminders and other options such as whether customers can join from a mobile browser without having to download Teams. To learn more, see [Create an appointment type](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-an-appointment-type-810eac77-6a65-4dc8-964d-c00eadf43887).

## Schedule a virtual consultation

In the booking calendar, select **New booking**. Select an appointment type, and then fill out the relevant information.

This includes customer contact information, the staff member who will be providing the service, internal notes that only staff can see, email reminders, and whether the customer can join from a mobile browser. To learn more, see [Schedule a booking in the Teams Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-booking-in-the-teams-bookings-app-e275049d-0d0f-4161-8526-461a9f29439f).

The email confirmation sent to the customer includes the meeting link and an attachment so that they can add the virtual appointment to their calendar. Staff also receive an email confirmation and meeting invite.

## Conduct a virtual consultation

In your Teams or Outlook calendar, go to the booking, and then select **Join** or the Teams meeting link. Check your audio and video settings, and then select **Join now**. To learn more, see [Conduct a Bookings appointment](https://support.microsoft.com/office/conduct-a-bookings-appointment-a86a4007-e26c-4909-9893-f7036e2747cd).
