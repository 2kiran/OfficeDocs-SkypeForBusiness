# Plan for Operator Connect

>[!NOTE]
>Operator Connect is currently available only in **public preview**. Public preview allows you to test upcoming features and provide feedback. Features included in public preview may not be complete, may undergo changes, and are not supported in Office 365 Government Cloud.

Operator Connect is another option for providing Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity with Teams and Phone System.  

This article describes benefits and requirements, and lists the operators participating in the Operator Connect Program.  If you decide Operator Connect is the right solution for your organization, after reading this article, see [Configure Operator Connect](operator-connect-configure.md).  

## Benefits

With Operator Connect, if your existing operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect program, they can manage the service for bringing PSTN calling to Teams. The Operator Connect program provides the following benefits:

- **Leverage existing contracts, or find a new operator.** You keep your preferred operator and contracts, or choose a new one from a selection of participating operators to meet your business needs.

- **Operator-managed infrastructure.** Your operator manages the PSTN calling services and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), allowing you to save on hardware purchase and management.

- **Faster, easier deployment.** You can quickly connect to your operator and assign phone numbers to users -– all from the Teams Admin Center.

- **Enhanced support and reliability.** Operators provide technical support and shared service level agreements to improve support service, while direct peering powered by Azure creates a one-to-one network connection for enhanced reliability.

## Requirements

 Operator Connect might be the right solution for your organization if:

- Microsoft Calling Plan is not available in your geographic location.
- Your preferred operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect program.
- You want to find a new operator to enable calling in Teams.

To enable phone number assignments with Operator Connect, make sure your users are:

- Teams Phone licensed. To learn more, see [What is Phone System?](what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) and [Assign Teams add-on licenses to users](teams-add-on-licensing/assign-teams-add-on-licenses.md).
- In TeamsOnly mode. To learn more, see [Understand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md).
