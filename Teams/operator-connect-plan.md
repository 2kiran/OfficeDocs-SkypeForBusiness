# Plan for Operator Connect

Operator Connect is another option for providing Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity with Teams and Phone System. 

## Benefits

With Operator Connect, if your existing operator is a participant in the Microsoft Operator Connect program, they can manage the service for bringing PSTN calling to Teams. The Operator Connect program provides the following benefits:

- **Leverage existing operator contracts.** You keep your preferred operator and contracts.

- **Operator-managed infrastructure.** Your operator manages the PSTN calling services and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), allowing you to save on hardware purchase and management.

- **Faster, easier deployment.** You can quickly connect to your operator and assign phone numbers to users -â€“ all from the Teams Admin Center. 

 - **Enhanced support and reliability.** Operators provide technical support and shared service level agreements to improve support service, while direct peering powered by Azure creates a 1:1 network connection for enhanced reliability.
