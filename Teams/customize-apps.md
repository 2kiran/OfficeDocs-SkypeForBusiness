# Customize apps in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature](includes/preview-feature.md)]

Now you can customize your organization's apps in Microsoft Teams. The features you can modify are:

- short name
- short description
- full description
- privacy policy URLs
- website URL
- terms of use URLs
- icon

> [!Note]
> Changes to branding will require 24 hours to take effect.

## Modify the app's features

1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Teams Apps** and select **Manage apps**.
3. Check the **Customizable** column of the apps list to find an app to customize.
4. Select the app that you want to modify, and then select **Customize**.

5. Expand the **Details** section and modify the following fields:

    - Short name
    - Short description
    - Full description
    - Website
    - Privacy policy URLs
    - Terms of use URLs

5. Expand the **Icon** section.

   In this section, you have the option to upload an icon or create your own. In addition to the icon, you can choose an app display background color.

6. Once your app has been customized, select **Apply**.

The modified app is now listed in your **Manage apps** page. You'll have only one version of the app, since modifying the apps features doesn't create a copy of the app.
