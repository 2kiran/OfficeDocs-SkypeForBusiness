# Manage the Updates app for your organization in Microsoft Teams

## What is the Updates app

The Updates app in Teams provides a centralized place for members of your organization to create, review, and submit reports. By creating templates, you can use the Updates app to keep track of anything your organization needs.

In Teams, users can get Updates from the Teams app store. They'll see all of the reports they need to submit on the **Submit** page.

**Who can create templates?**

When a user is assigned a report, it will show up in their Teams activity feed. Users can also view all their current update requests and previous submissions in the Updates app.

## Set up Updates

**this is where I need input**

## Templates

Updates comes with both out-of-the-box templates for common business scenarios and the option to create your own template. **will instructions on using templates be here or in an end-user content set?**

## Example scenario

Employees at a clothing store are responsible for counting the till at opening and closing time every day. Whoever is in charge of counting fills out the report in Updates, where they can also explain any discrepancies. Sales staff also receive a number of requests for a certain sold-out item. They submit an inventory report to let the operations office know that the item is in high demand. Every 6 months, the store manager submits employee performance reviews in Updates.

Meanwhile, a team of remote workers is updating the store's website. They're spread across time zones, so daily stand-up meetings aren't convenient. Instead, each of the team members submits daily Updates reports on their progress to the team leader.
