# Choose a path to your organization-wide rollout of Microsoft Teams

Now that you've successfully set up your first teams and onboarded an initial group of users while driving usage, it's time to look at your go-forward plan to deploy Teams across the rest of your organization while driving adoption.

> [!TIP]
> Before you begin your Teams rollout, we strongly recommend that you complete the [Prepare for a Teams deployment with Microsoft 365](/learn/modules/m365-teams-collab-prepare-deployment/) Microsoft Learn module. This 30 minute module will jump-start your understanding of Teams and talk through key decisions you need to make as you roll out Teams.
>
> If you want to check out more learning paths and modules available for Teams, see [Microsoft Learn for Teams](/learn/teams/).

Select **Small business** if you only have a few employees or don't have multiple locations or a complex network.

Select **Medium/large business** if you want to create a formal adoption process for key stakeholders; have multiple locations or a large network with proxy servers or multiple firewalls; have complex compliance requirements; or have other non-standard requirements that require extra planning.

#### [Small business](#tab/SmallBusiness)

There are lots of ways you can customize Teams. The following sections show you how to set up each Teams workload: **chats, teams and channels**; **meetings and conferencing**; and **cloud voice**. The order in which you set up each workload is up to you. While we recommend setting up the chats, teams, and channels workload first, you can start with meetings and conferencing or even cloud voice. The choice is yours.
