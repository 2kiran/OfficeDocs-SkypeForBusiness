# Choose a path to your organization-wide rollout of Microsoft Teams

Now that you've successfully set up your first teams and onboarded an initial group of users while driving usage, it's time to look at your go-forward plan to deploy Teams across the rest of your organization while driving adoption.

> [!TIP]
> Before you begin your Teams rollout, we strongly recommend that you complete the [Prepare for a Teams deployment with Microsoft 365](/learn/modules/m365-teams-collab-prepare-deployment/) Microsoft Learn module. This 30 minute module will jump-start your understanding of Teams and talk through key decisions you need to make as you roll out Teams.
>
> If you want to check out more learning paths and modules available for Teams, see [Microsoft Learn for Teams](/learn/teams/).

Select **Small business** if you only have a few employees or don't have multiple locations or a complex network.

Select **Medium/large business** if you want to create a formal adoption process for key stakeholders; have multiple locations or a large network with proxy servers or multiple firewalls; have complex compliance requirements; or have other non-standard requirements that require extra planning.

#### [Small business](#tab/SmallBusiness)

There are lots of ways you can customize Teams. The following sections show you how to set up each Teams workload: **chats, teams and channels**; **meetings and conferencing**; and **cloud voice**. The order in which you set up each workload is up to you. While we recommend setting up the chats, teams, and channels workload first, you can start with meetings and conferencing or even cloud voice. The choice is yours.

Before you roll out Teams broadly, make sure your organization is ready by reviewing the items in [Make sure you're ready](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md#make-sure-youre-ready).

### Chat, teams, and channels

Chat, teams, and channels, are the cornerstone of Teams. **Chat** lets one or more users talk to each other, share files, and meet privately. **Teams**, which can be visible to everyone in your organization or only to those in the team, let the right people collaborate whatever the task or occasion, whether it's a long-running project or planning for a birthday party. **Channels** within teams can segment topics, projects, departments, or anything else make sense for your team. For details about chat, teams, and channels, check out [Overview of teams and channels](teams-channels-overview.md).

As you think about rolling out teams and channels, you need to decide who should be able to create them, what policies should be applied to them, whether guests from outside your organization can access them, and so on. The article [Chat, teams, channels, & apps in Microsoft Teams](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) has lots of information about planning for chat, teams, and channels, however, here are some key things from that article you should think about:

| [Teams administrators](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md#teams-administrators)         | Admin roles can be used to grant specific permissions to people who you want to administer Teams. Small businesses may not need these extra roles because the same person may be responsible for all aspects of Teams. You can always add or remove administrators later on.                                                                                                         | [Use Microsoft Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](using-admin-roles.md) |
| [Teams owners and members](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md#teams-owners-and-members) | Team owners control who can access a team and its channels. They can decide whether a team or channel is public (to the organization) or private and can set up policies like whether a channel should be moderated. Members can access the team and its channels (unless a channel is set to private and they're not a member of that channel) and can be designated as moderators. | [Moderator capabilities](assign-roles-permissions.md)                           |
