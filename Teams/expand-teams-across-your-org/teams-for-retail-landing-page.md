# Teams for Retail

Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams offer several capabilities that can help retail organizations with their daily operations and digital transformation, including:

| Capability | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| [Teams apps for retail](#teams-apps-for-retail) | Ensure that your workers can communicate, collaborate, and deliver great customer service with apps like Shifts, Bookings, RealWear, Walkie Talkie, Tasks, Lists, Praise, and so on. |
| [Teams templates for retail](#teams-templates-for-retail)| Create teams that include a predefined template of settings, channels, and pre-installed apps for communication and collaboration within an individual store, with a region, or between headquarters and your staff wherever they are.|
| [Teams policy packages for frontline workers](#teams-policy-packages-for-frontline-workers)| Ensure that your sales associates and other frontline workers have the appropriate access to Teams functionality. |
| [Scripted deployment](#scripted-deployment-for-frontline-workers)| The ability to quickly add frontline workers with a scripted deployment. |

For all of these capabilities, users mush have an appropriate license. Office 365 A3, A5, E3, and E5, as well as Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Business Premium, A3, A5, E3, and E5 are supported. You can also use Microsoft 365 Frontline Worker F1 and F3 or Office 365 F3. For more information about general Teams licensing, see [Manage user access to Teams](../../user-access.md). See [Retail user types and licensing](#retail-user-types-and-licensing) for more about using Microsoft 365 Frontline Worker in combination with other licenses.

This functionality is also part of the Microsoft Cloud for Retail. Learn more about using this solution, which brings together capabilities from Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 at [Microsoft Cloud for Retail](/industry/retail).

The following scenarios are available for retail organizations:

## Retail user types and licensing

In retail environments, you most likely have a mix of user types in your organization:

- Information workers, who probably have desktop or laptop computers, and likely work more on documents than directly with customers, such as corporate staff and managers.
- Frontline workers, who work on tablets or phones, and work either directly with customers or in store operations, such as sales associates, stockers, and pickers.

Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams have features and a licensing model to support both types of users for your Retail organization. [Microsoft 365 for Frontline Workers](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline) is optimized for a mobile workforce that primarily interacts with customers, but also needs to stay connected to the rest of your organization. 

### Assign appropriate licenses to support frontline worker and information worker user types

If it makes sense for your organization, you can assign different licenses to these different types of users. The following illustration shows one way to apply licenses and policies for Retail workers:

:::image type="content" source="../media/retail-license-options.png" alt-text="Mix license types to support the different roles in your organization. Use Enterprise licenses for your information workers, such as corporate staff and managers, and Frontline Worker licenses for mobile workers, such as sales associates, shipping staff, stockers, and pickers.":::

With this example, you can mix license types for the two types of workers in your organization, like in the following table:

| Information workers have an Enterprise license and can: | Frontline workers have a Frontline Worker license and can: |
| ----- | ----- |
| Use full Office apps on desktops or laptops, as well as mobile apps on phones and tablets | Use mobile apps on phones or tablets (not desktops or laptops) |
| Use all Teams functionality (depending on the specific license) | Use Teams to: chat, meet, see notifications, use Lists, use Shifts and store documents |
| Use all included Microsoft 365 services (depending on the specific license) | Use SharePoint, OneDrive, Yammer, Stream |

For a detailed comparison of what's included in Microsoft 365 with various licenses, see this [Comparison table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139145).

Additional capabilities for retail environments are available with the Microsoft Cloud for Retail, which includes capabilities from Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Azure as well as the Microsoft 365 features. For more information, see [Microsoft Cloud for Retail](https://www.microsoft.com/industry/retail/microsoft-cloud-for-retail).

Of course, for simplicity, or if your workers all need access to the full capabilities of Microsoft 365, you can use the same Enterprise license for all of your worker types, and still target capabilities to different user roles using Teams policy packages, such as the Frontline Worker [policy package](../manage-policy-packages.md).
