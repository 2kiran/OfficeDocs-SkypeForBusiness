# Virtual visits with Microsoft Teams

Use the complete meeting platform in Teams to schedule, manage, and conduct virtual visits for staff and attendees. This article gives you an overview of the capabilities available in Teams for scheduling and managing virtual visits.

## The Bookings app

The [Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5) in Teams gives organizations a simple way to schedule and manage virtual appointments. Use it to schedule virtual appointments such as healthcare visits, financial consultations, interviews, customer support, virtual fittings and consultations, education office hours, and more.

Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well as communications with internal and external attendees, from a single experience.

Each virtual appointment includes a Teams meeting link thatâ€™s sent to attendees in email where they can easily join from a web browser or in Teams on any device.

## Teams Electronic Health Records (EHR) connector

If your healthcare organization uses Electronic Health Records (EHR), you can integrate Teams with your EHR system for a more seamless experience. After you set up the Teams EHR connector,  clinicians can launch virtual visits with patients and consultations with other providers in Teams directly from the EHR system.

Currently, the Teams EHR connector supports integration with the Cerner EHR system and Epic EHR system. To learn more, see:
