# Virtual visits with Microsoft Teams

Use the complete meeting platform in Teams to schedule, manage, and conduct virtual visits for staff and attendees. This article gives you an overview of the capabilities that Teams offers for virtual appointments.

## The Bookings app

The [Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5) in Teams gives organizations a simple way to schedule and manage virtual appointments. Use it to schedule virtual appointments such as healthcare visits, financial consultations, interviews, customer support, virtual fittings and consultations, education office hours, and more.

Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well as communications with internal and external attendees, from a single experience.

Each virtual appointment includes a Teams meeting link thatâ€™s sent to attendees in email where they can easily join from a web browser or in Teams on any device.

## Teams Electronic Health Records (EHR) connector

If your healthcare organization uses Electronic Health Records (EHR), you can integrate Teams with your EHR system for a more seamless experience. The Teams EHR connector makes it easy for clinicians to launch virtual visits with patients and consultations with other providers in Teams directly from the EHR system.

Teams enables simple, secure collaboration and communication with chat, video, voice, and healthcare tools in a single hub that supports compliance with HIPAA, HITECH certification, and more.

Currently, the Teams EHR connector supports integration with the Cerner EHR system and Epic EHR system. To learn more, see:
