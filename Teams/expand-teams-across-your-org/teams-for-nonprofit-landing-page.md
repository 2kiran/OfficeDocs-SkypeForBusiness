# Teams for Nonprofit organizations

Nonprofit organizations have a lot of unique business needs that Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams can help with. In particular, nonprofits often rely on a large volume of volunteers to help achieve their mission outcomes. So coordinating and communicating with both an organization's staff and external, often unpaid, staff is key.

The following templates can help you manage your volunteer workforce:

- Use the [Volunteer center SharePoint template]() to set up a central hub for your volunteers to access key information. Welcome new volunteers, post announcements, showcase upcoming events, and introduce your organization and staff. Provide easy access to training and onboarding materials, and key sites.
- Use the [Nonprofit team templates](../team-templates-nonprofit.md) to quickly and easily set up teams in Microsoft Teams for your staff to communicate and collaborate on volunteer management tasks and activities. This template includes settings, channels, and apps designed to streamline volunteer management activities. It integrates with Volunteer Management and enables staff to manage documents and work in their app of choice, across multiple devices. Your staff can use different channels to collaborate on volunteer engagement opportunities, organize and share onboarding materials and frequently used documents, view reporting, and post important team and event announcements.

Teams features for nonprofit organizations are also part of the Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit. Learn more about using this solution, which brings together capabilities from Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Azure, and LinkedIn at [Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit](/industry/nonprofit).
