# Virtual visits with Teams - Integration into EHR

Microsoft Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) Connector makes it easy for clinicians to launch a virtual patient visit or consultation with another provider in Teams directly from the EHR system. Built on the Microsoft 365 cloud, Microsoft Teams enables simple, secure collaboration and communication with chat, video, voice, and healthcare tools in a single hub that supports compliance with HIPAA, HITECH certification, and more.

The communication and collaboration platform of Teams makes it easy for clinicians to cut through the clutter of fragmented systems so they can spend time providing the best possible care. Microsoft Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) Connector can:

- Launch Teams virtual visits from both provider and patient portals.

- Write back into EHR metadata on connect and disconnect events to enable automatic auditing and record keeping.

- Integrate into existing clinician and patient workflows while allowing them to use Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

You’ll need to make sure you have the following prerequisites before you can integrate the EHR connector:

- Active subscription to Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare or subscription to Microsoft Teams EHR Connector standalone offer.

- Users must have an appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license that includes Microsoft Teams meetings.

- Microsoft Teams should be adopted and used inside the organization.

- Organizations must have with Epic version November 2018 or later.

- Your systems must meet all [software and browser prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app).

You’ll also need information from the following people in your organization:

- Microsoft 365 administrator

- Epic administrator

> [!Note]
> Request your Epic admin to provide the Epic-Microsoft Teams Telehealth Integration Guide available in the Epic marketplace.

## Connector setup

The connector setup requires that you:

- [Launch the EHR Connector configuration portal](ehr-admin.md#launch-the-ehr-connector-configuration-portal)
- [Configure provider organization information](ehr-admin.md#configure-provider-organization-information)
- [Verify and approve the configuration](ehr-admin.md#verify-and-approve-the-configuration)
- [Review and finish the configuration](ehr-admin.md#review-and-finish-the-configuration)

### [Launch the EHR Connector configuration portal](#launch-the-ehr-connector-configuration-portal)

Configuring your healthcare organization to launch virtual visits with Microsoft Teams starts by launching the EHR Connector configuration portal. Use the test URL to configure the connector for your Epic test environment. Use the production URL when you're ready to enable your Epic production environment.
  
- Test environment [https://ehrconnector-ppe.teams.microsoft.com](https://ehrconnector-ppe.teams.microsoft.com)
- Production environment [https://ehrconnector.teams.microsoft.com](https://ehrconnector.teams.microsoft.com)

The Microsoft 365 admin and Epic admin from your organization must complete the information and integration steps in the configuration portal. For Epic configuration steps, contact the Epic resource assigned to your organization.

### [Configure provider organization information](#configure-provider-organization-information)

This step is to be completed by the Microsoft 365 administrator. The Microsoft 365 administrator must launch the connector configuration portal and sign in with Microsoft credentials to start the configuration process.

To complete this step, the Microsoft 365 administrator must receive a valid Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) base URL from your Microsoft 365 administrator and the username of the Epic administrator who will be approving the configuration. The Microsoft 365 administrator must launch the connector configuration page and sign in with Microsoft credentials to start the configuration process.

- The FHIR base URL is a static address corresponding to your server FHIR API endpoint. An example URL is [https://lamnahealthcare.org/fihr/auth/connect-ocurprd-oauth/api/FHDST](https://lamnahealthcare.org/fihr/auth/connect-ocurprd-oauth/api/FHDST).

- Configuration approver name is the name of the Epic system administrator who will be responsible for approving the configuration.

### [Verify and approve the configuration](#verify-and-approve-the-configuration)

The Epic administrator for your healthcare organization who was added as an approver must now use the same EHR Connector URL from the previous step to sign in using their Microsoft 365 credentials. After successful validation, the approver is going to be asked to sign in using their Epic credentials to validate the Epic organization.

> [!Note]
> The Microsoft 365 admin and Epic admin in your organizations can be the same person. In that case, add your own username as approver in the first step. You'll still need to sign in to Epic to validate your access. The Epic sign in is only used to validate your FHIR base URL. Microsoft will not store credentials or access EHR data with this sign in.

  ![Verify and approve the credential configuration.](../../media/ehc-provider-2.png)

After a successful Epic sign in, the Epic administrator **must** approve the configuration. If the configuration isn't correct, the Microsoft 365 admin will have the ability to modify the original configurations by signing in to the Microsoft EHR Connector portal again.

![Confirm that the EHR connector is configured and option to change the configuration.](../../media/ehc-approve-3.png)

### [Review and finish the configuration](#review-and-finish-the-configuration)

When the configuration information is approved by the Epic administrator, you'll be presented with integration records for patient and provider launch. These records are necessary to complete the virtual visit configuration in Epic. Refer to the Epic-Microsoft Teams Telehealth Integration guide for more details.

> [!Note]  
> At any time the Microsoft 365 or Epic administrator can sign in to the configuration portal to view integration records and modify organization configuration, if needed.

## Launch Teams virtual visits

After completing the EHR Connector steps and Epic configuration, your organization is ready to support video visits with Microsoft Teams.

### Virtual visit prerequisites

- Your systems must meet all [software and browser prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app).

- Healthcare organization must have completed the setup between the Epic organization and Microsoft 365 organization.

### Provider experience

Healthcare providers from your organization can also join virtual visits with Microsoft Teams from their Epic provider applications (Hyperspace, Haiku, Canto). The **Begin virtual visit** button is embedded in the provider flow.

Key features of the provider experience:

- Providers can join virtual visits using supported browsers or the Microsoft Teams application.

- Providers must do a one time sign in with their Microsoft 365 account when joining a virtual visit for the first time.

- After the one time sign in, the provider will be taken straight to the virtual appointment in Microsoft Teams. (Provider must be signed-in to Microsoft Teams).

- Provider can see real-time updates of participants connect and disconnect for a given appointment. The provider can see when the patient is connected to a virtual visit.

### Patient experience

The connector supports patients joining virtual visits through MyChart web and mobile. At the time of the appointment, patients can start a virtual visit from MyChart using the **Begin virtual visit** button.

Key features of the patient experience:

- Patients can join virtual visits from modern web browsers on desktop and mobile without app installation.

- Patients can join virtual visits with a single click and there is no additional account or sign in required.

- Patients aren't required to create a Microsoft account or sign in to launch a virtual visit.

- Patients will be placed in a lobby until the healthcare provider joins the appointment and admits them to the virtual visit.

- Testing of the video and microphone is available in the lobby before joining the virtual visit.

### Privacy and location of data

Teams integration into EHR systems optimizes the amount of data being used and stored during integration and virtual visit flows. The solution follows the overall Teams privacy and data management principles and guidelines outlined in Teams Privacy.

The Microsoft Teams EHR connector doesn't store nor transfer any identifiable personal data or any health records of patients or healthcare providers from the EHR system. The only data that is stored by the EHR connector is the EHR user’s unique ID, which is used during Teams meeting setup. The EHR user’s unique ID is stored in one of the three geographic regions described in the [Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations?view=o365-worldwide#data-center-geographies) article. All chat, recordings, and other data entered into Teams by the meeting participants are stored according to existing storage policies. If you want to learn more information on the location of data in Microsoft Teams, visit [Locations of data in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams).
