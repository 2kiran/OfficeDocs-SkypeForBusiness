# Use the Frontline Worker onboarding wizard to get your frontline workforce up and running

## Overview

The Frontline Worker onboarding wizard in the Microsoft 365 admin center simplifies onboarding frontline workers to your organization. The wizard lets you quickly deploy an experience in Microsoft Teams that's tailored to your frontline workforce. Using the wizard, you can easily kick off your pilot deployment of Teams for the frontline workers in your organization.

The wizard sets up a team for your frontline workers and assigns licenses and [policy packages](manage-policy-packages.md) to each team member. You can create your team from scratch or from a [team template](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md), and then you add users and assign roles. The role determines the policy package that the wizard assigns to each user.

The wizard is available to all organizations that have at least one Microsoft 365 F license. You can run the wizard as many times as you need to roll out Teams to your frontline workforce in different locations or sites across your organization.

## Run the wizard

1. In the left navigation of the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), select **Setup**. Go to the **Apps and email** section, and then under **Get your frontline workforce up and running**, select **View**. Here, you can learn more about the capabilities that Microsoft 365 for frontline workers offers.

2. When you're ready, select **Get started** to run the wizard.

3. Enter a name for your team, select a privacy setting, and add one or more team owners. Then, choose whether to create your team from scratch or from a team template. Team templates come with predefined channels and tabs, which optimize the team for a particular business need or project.

4. Add users to the team. You can also add groups. If you add groups, keep in mind that licenses and policy packages are directly assigned to each user in the group, not the group itself.

5. Assign one of the following roles to each team member.

    - Frontline worker
    - Frontline manager
    - None

    By assigning a Frontline worker or Frontline manager role, that user will receive an experience in Teams that's tailored to their role. This includes pre-pinned apps and policies for healthy frontline worker and manager communication and collaboration.

    Next, assign a Microsoft 365 F license to each team member. If you donâ€™t have enough licenses, you can select **Buy more licenses** to purchase more licenses.  

6. Choose who receives the status email after the wizard is completed. The email contains success and failure information about the actions performed by the wizard&mdash;creating the team, adding team members, and assigning a license and policy package to each team member. Use this information to troubleshoot any errors that may occur.

7. Review your selections, and then select **Confirm**.

    The wizard creates your team and assigns licenses and policy packages to team members. This may take a few minutes to complete, after which the recipients you chose receive a status email.

8. You're on your way but you're not done yet! Next, check out the [What to do after running the wizard](#what-to-do-after-running-the-wizard) section of this article.

## What to do after running the wizard

After you run the wizard, it's important to:

- Let your frontline workers and managers know that they're assigned Teams licenses.
- If you're using shared devices, make sure Teams is installed on those devices. If your organization uses a "bring your own device" model, let your frontline workers and managers know that they have to download and install Teams to their devices.

When the frontline employee opens Teams for the first time, they'll receive a tailored first run experience, which includes chats and channels, calling, and task management all within Teams.
