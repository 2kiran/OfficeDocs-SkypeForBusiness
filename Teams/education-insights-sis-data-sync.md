# Sync Student Information System (SIS) data with Education Insights
The more data is fed into [Education Insights](class-insights.md), the better educators can support their students, and education leaders can support the educators.

To provide organization-level Insights, we must use [School Data Sync (SDS)](/SchoolDataSync) to connect to the Student Information System (SIS) so that Insights has the hierarchical structure of the educational system mapped correctly. 

Viewing class-level Insights as the class educator *does not* require this sync because we use Teams' class structure and permissions.

## Plan your School Data Sync integration
The Microsoft School Data Sync (a.k.a SDS) provides the School Information System (a.k.a SIS) data and itâ€™s hierarchical structure of the educational system and maps which user is assigned where, as well as provides additional data on the student and organizational hierarchy.

Insights works best when using [SDS V2 file format](/schooldatasync/sds-v2-csv-file-format) and up, but also supports [SDS V1 file format](/schooldatasync/school-data-sync-format-csv-files-for-sds) *with limited functionality*.


### Differences between SDS V1 and V2 file formats

To get the most out of insights it is recommended to use file format v2 or v2.1 (Coming soon)

| Data type | V1 | V2 |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Users** | The V1 format contains **only educators**, so to set org-level permissions for your education leaders, you need to define each one's permission manually. | The V2 format contains **all the roles** so that you can assign role-based permissions. |
| **Orgs** | The V1 format contains **only schools**, so you see only one aggregation level (all your schools). You can zoom in to a specific school using a flat list, but this list may have a large number of schools or contain different types of schools that are hard to compare (such as primary to secondary school or science to art school).<br/><br/> When there is a hierarchy in place, you can create levels that make sense, such as a science or art department.| The V2 format contains **the full hierarchy of your district or institution**, including universities, colleges, faculties, campuses, regions, programs, and so on.<br/><br/> With a hierarchy, you can see relevant aggregation by each level of the hierarchy, quickly compare between organizational units at each level, assign permission to specific levels, set goals by org level, and so on.|

> [!NOTE]
> Customers will not be able on onboard file format v2 starting July 15th 2021, and will need to use the v2.1 format instead, all future upgrades and new capabilitie will be done on the v2.1 format and it will be fully backward compatible to file format v1.

## Best practices
The accurate mapping of the hierarchy and where everyone belongs within that hierarchy, enables Insights to provide accurate data and more precise and relevant insights for the different types of education leaders.

The more detail you provide, the better and more relevant the reports and spotlights will be.

Here are some best practices to ensure the smooth deployment of SDS so that your users can make the most out of Insights.

### File format version to ue
*	Use file format V2.1 (coming soon) and sync the optional data used by Education Insights

### Users and Roles
*	Make sure **all users are listed in the files** you provide and synced. This includes all students and staff that need to see data for the organizational units they cover.
    If you currently only have educators listed in the SIS, add the other users manually before uploading the files to SDS and syncing the data.
    The stats gathered by Insights is only from the registered students, if some students re missing, that will make the data and conclusions misleading.
	
*	Make sure to **provide the first and last name of each user**. Otherwise, they will be referenced by their email address, and this provides a non-optimal experience in the reports and spotlights (cards with Insights on student activity or performance).

*	The grade/year level must be based on this [mapping list](#supported-grade-level-values). 

*	It's important to **add the year/grade level to all students** so that the activity data can be aggregated and filtered by it.    

*	Make sure to **assign each user to their relevant organizational unit**. That way, Education Insights will not show misleading data in the Education Inisghts spotlights.

    *	A student can be associated to more than one organizational unit, for example, students who are registered in a special program or two faculties. In case the student has more hte one organizational unit, provide a line for each in the users file for that student.
	
    *	IT admin can grant permissions based on organizational unit for staff. **Make sure staff members are associated with the correct unit level**, so they receive the permissions they need. For example, a counselor assigned to four schools needs to see all the grades in those schools; a principal needs to see all the classes in their school. 
	
*	**The role is vital**. Although this list is closed, try to match the role from [the list](/schooldatasync/sds-v2-csv-file-format#enumerated-values-enum-supported) to the real role of each user you upload. This will enable you to assign role-based permissions accordingly. For example, provide permissions for all principals to see the classes in their school, or for all professors to see their faculty. 

### Organizations

* Make sure to **reflect the real and full hierarchy of your organization**. This can be achieved by manually adding the file. In some cases, this hierarchy is not reflected in the SIS. Still, it may be necessary  to see the relevant aggregation by each level of the hierarchy, assign permission to specific levels, set goals by organization level, and so on. 

* Ensure that **all organization units down the organization tree include students or classes** to aggregate student data for them. We recommend that students are on the lowest branch of the tree.

## Integrate SIS data using SDS

School Data Sync (SDS) is provided with Office 365 for Education. SDS reads the data from an educational institution's Student Information System (SIS) and integrates it with Microsoft applications like Teams to enable the automatic creation of online classrooms and users.

It also synchronizes the SIS data with Insights.

As an IT Admin, you can choose to use SDS for provisioning only, Insights only or for both.

To Sync your SIS information with Educations Insights follow the instructions in [How to deploy SDS for Insights](/schooldatasync/how-to-deploy-sds-for-insights).

### Deploy SDS
**If you already use SDS**, we recommend you follow our [best practices](#best-practices). 

**If you don't use SDS yet**, you now need to [deploy it](/schooldatasync/deploying-school-data-sync).

During the deployment process, you can decide if you want to use SDS for provisioning users and classes to Teams or to use it only to provide user and organizational hierarchy to Insights as well.

> [!NOTE]
> If it's the middle of the year and you already created teams manually, use SDS only to provide the user and organizational hierarchy data to Insights, and next year consider using SDS for provisioning users and classes for Teams as well.

### Verify the sync process
To verify the sync status progress follow the instructions in [SDS for Insights Data Health and Monitoring](/schooldatasync/sds-for-insights-data-health-and-monitoring).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you run into any problems, [customer support](https://aka.ms/edusupport) is there to help you.

## Supported grade level values

In the SDS files, grade/year level defined as Enumerated values, which means you can only provide a selected set of values within the CSV file. Anything other than values specified will result in an error during sync processing.

The section below defines the supported values in the users file.
