# Implement your move to Microsoft Teams 

## Overview 

After taking the time to plan and prepare for your organization’s move from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams, it’s time to deploy and implement Teams.  
 
1. For organizations **already using Microsoft Teams**, this article is part of Deployment and Implementation stage of your journey from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams.  

   **Before proceeding, confirm that you've completed the following activities**: 
   
   - Envisioned teamwork for your organization  
   
   - Identified champions and critical stakeholders 
   
   - Defined your project scope  
   
   - Piloted Microsoft Teams 
   
   - Prepared your organization 

   Follow the guidance in this article, if you **already have Microsoft Teams rolled out** and want to move your licensed users from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams. 
   
   We recommend the following framework for transition:  
   
    - **Plan for your transition** 
   
      1. First, move your chat groups to Microsoft Teams.  
    
      2. Next, leverage apps in Teams to replace Kaizala action cards. 
    
      3. To ensure that frontline workers are equipped, upgrade to Teams Frontline Worker functionality.  For a quick start guide on Teams Frontline Worker, see [Frontline Worker Quick Start Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/flw-quickstart).  
    
      4. Consider Onboarding suppliers and partners to invite as guests in Teams.  
  
    - **Manage change**  
   
      Create a communication campaign to raise awareness on the transition project. Notify your organization of the change and identify champions to drive adoption of Microsoft Teams. Empower your users to learn more about Microsoft Teams through free training. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams video training](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/microsoft-teams-video-training-4f108e54-240b-4351-8084-b1089f0d21d7?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).   
 
2. For organizations **not yet using Microsoft Teams**, this article is part of Deployment and Implementation stage of your journey from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams.  

   Follow the guidance in this section, if you are using Kaizala and want to move your users from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams.
   
   **Before proceeding, confirm that you've completed the following activities**: 
   
   - Envisioned teamwork for your organization 
    
   - Identified champions and critical stakeholders 
   
   - Defined your project scope

   - Prepared your organization  
   
   We recommend the following framework for transition: 
   
   - **Envision teamwork for your organization** 
   
     List the current scenarios in which Kaizala is used. Next, envision scenarios above and beyond with Microsoft Teams.  

   - **Pilot Teams**
   
     Roll out Teams to a Pilot group of users with a prioritized scenario set. 

   - **Deploy Teams** 
   
     Learn from the pilot group. Prepare to roll out to the complete organization.  

   - **Use Kaizala and Teams**  
   
     To find the right Microsoft Teams for your business, see [Compare Microsoft Teams Online Options | Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options). 

   - **Manage change** 
   
     Prepare your organization for change through end user training to drive adoption. IT Admins and Champions can drive efforts to influence positive change management on the move.  

   - **Plan for your adoption of Teams**

     Prepare to move custom solutions from Kaizala to Teams e.g. Custom Action cards. 
     
   - **Move your organization to Teams** 
   
     Empower your organization with a streamlined tool for communication from CEO to the frontline!
