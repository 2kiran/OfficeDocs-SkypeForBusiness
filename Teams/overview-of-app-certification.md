# Microsoft 365 app compliance program

Microsoft compliance program demonstrates that an app is vetted against controls derived from leading industry standard frameworks, and that strong security and compliance practices are in place to protect customer data. The program has two phases:

* Publisher attestation.
* Microsoft 365 certification.

## Publisher attestation

Publisher attestation is the next tier in the app compliance program. Publisher attested apps provide added confidence to admins about security and compliance measures of an app and reduce the time to review it for an app. The attestation will reflect an app's security, data handling, and compliance practices against more than 80 risk factors identified by [Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/cloud-app-security).

App developers are asked to complete a self-assessment that includes questions frequently asked by customers and IT admins to evaluate the security and compliance of an app. Microsoft then publishes this information for easier and more timely evaluation. To know more, see [Attestation guide](/microsoft-365-app-certification/docs/enterprise-app-attestation-guide).

Admins can quickly check for Published attested apps in three different ways.

* On the web, when gathering more information about an app, see the details of a specific app at its link at [Microsoft Teams apps security and compliance](/microsoft-365-app-certification/teams/teams-apps). Alternately, click the Publisher attestation link in Teams admin center.

* In Teams admin center, when checking the details of an app from the **Manage App** page, see the publisher attested icon on the banner in the app's detail page.

* In Teams admin center, when granting permissions to the app, a blue checkmark in front of the app name indicates that it is either a publisher attested app or a Microsoft 365 certified app.

   :::image type="content" source="media/attested-app-tac2.png" alt-text="In Teams admin center, on the dialog to grant permissions, admins can check the blue checkmark to be assured that the app is publisher attested.":::

The attestation details page for an attested or certified app lists the following details.

## Microsoft 365 certification

App certification is achieved through a qualified analyst's review and approval of a comprehensive assessment centering on an app's security and compliance frameworks, processes, and procedures. The app is vetted against a series of security controls derived from leading industry standard frameworks. The certificate demonstrates that strong security and compliance practices are in place to protect customer data when the app is activated in an organization.

<!--- TBD: Parking some content for later review. Check if this content needs to be published.

We also have a few more quality and security checks for apps. We have launched Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) program for the customer who have E5 or EMS license, where we rate risk for your cloud apps based on regulatory certification, industry standards, and best practices. We are also working on an Apps Quality Score system (launching soon) for all apps on Teams platform, and you will be able to check an appâ€™s quality score quickly on Teams Store.
