# Manage the usage of a phone number

Sometimes, there is a need to change the usage of a phone number after it was acquired or ported in. Phone number usage can be modified using the Teams admin center.

This article describes how to manage usage of a phone number to be used as either a Service or User number.

To change the usage of a phone number by using the Teams admin center:

1. Open the Microsoft Teams admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin or a Teams administrator. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.

2. In the left navigation, click **Voice** \> **Phone numbers**.

3. On the **Phone numbers** page, select an unassigned number in the list, and then click **Change usage**. 

      > [!NOTE]
      > Make sure you're selecting an **unassigned** number before trying to change the usage of it, otherwise the option won't be visible. If the number is currently assigned, you need to [remove the phone number from a user](/MicrosoftTeams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user#remove-a-phone-number-from-a-user) or resource account first.

4. In the **Change usage** pane, open the list of Available usages for the phone number, and then click on the intended option to select it.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The list will only display usages that are  available for the telephone number, depending on its number type (geographic, non-geographic, or toll-free) and supplier. You can quickly review the available usages for each phone number by setting visible the **Available usages** column in the Phone numbers table.

5. Click **Apply** to set the Licensed usage.
