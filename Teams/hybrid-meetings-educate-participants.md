| Tasks                                                         | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Room preparation**                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Choose a Teams Rooms-enabled space                            | Teams Rooms spaces set up using this or similar solutions give participants the best Teams meeting experience.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Turn on the in-room camera                                    | Turn on the in-room camera so remote participants can see who's talking and feel more connected with those in the room. Remote participants can feel more isolated if they can't see team members.                                                              |
| Show Front Row on the room display                            | Turn on the Front Row display of remote participants' cameras. Front Row prominently displays remote participants' cameras on the in-room display, giving them an equal presence in the room with in-room participants.                                         |
| **Meeting preparation**                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Nominate an in-room assistant                                 | An in-room assistant can help remote organizers and presenters set up the room for the meeting, help with in-room issues that may come up during the meeting, and ensure remote participants are given equal opportunity to participate in meeting discussions. |
| Nominate a chat and reactions monitor                         | A meeting monitor can help organizers and presenters focus on content by collecting or answering questions in chat and watching for participants who use the "raise hand" reaction.                                                                             |
| **In-meeting tasks**                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Welcome in-room and remote participants                       | Make a point to welcome both in-room and remote participants, and establish guidelines for how the meeting will proceed, to help ensure participants don't talk over each other or be overlooked during discussions.                                            |
| Encourage use of in-room and remote participant cameras       | Using participant cameras helps all participants see who's talking. This is especially important for in-room participants because remote participants may have difficulty seeing who's speaking if a room camera is too far away or turned off.                 |
| Encourage in-room and remote participants to use meeting chat | Using meeting chat helps ensure all participants can follow side conversations and questions during the meeting.                                                                                                                                                |
| Encourage the use of the "raise hand" and other reactions     | The usage of the "raise hand" and other reactions by both in-room and remote participants helps ensure all participants have an equal opportunity to add to discussions.                                                                                        |
| Watch for and respond to the "raise hand" reaction            | Presenters and organizers, or meeting monitors, need to look for "raise hand" and other reactions for them to be useful. Check for these reactions regularly throughout the meeting.                                                                            |
| Perform periodic call quality check-ins                       | Check with remote participants periodically to make sure call audio and video, and meeting content like PowerPoint sides, are free of noise and artifacts.                                                                                                      |
| **Post-meeting tasks**                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Request post-meeting feedback from participants               | Ask participants to send feedback on what went well with the meeting and how it could be improved. Ask how interaction between remote and in-room participants could be improved.                                                                               |
| Review meeting chat and follow up with participants           | Be sure to check the meeting chat to answer any outstanding questions or add your input to side discussions.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Review post-meeting feedback                                  | Make a plan to review meeting feedback and discuss with participants, IT or audio-visual departments, and others, to improve future meeting experiences.                                                                                                        |
