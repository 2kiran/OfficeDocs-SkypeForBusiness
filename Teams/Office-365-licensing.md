For more information about getting Teams, check out [How do I get access to Microsoft Teams?](https://support.office.com/article/How-do-I-get-access-to-Microsoft-Teams-fc7f1634-abd3-4f26-a597-9df16e4ca65b)

> [!NOTE]
> Teams is also available for non-profit organizations.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting August 2019, all new Office 365 customers will be onboarded to Teams and will not have access to Skype for Business Online. Tenants that are already using Skype for Business Online will be able to continue doing so (including provisioning new users) until they complete their transition to Teams. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams now the primary client for meetings and calling in Office 365](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4465277/microsoft-teams-now-the-primary-client-for-meetings-and-calling).

> [!NOTE]
> If Skype for Business Online is listed in apps for the selected license, do not remove it. If it's listed and is removed, Teams user setup will not complete successfully.
        
In terms of Teams core functionalities, there are no differences between the subscriptions. The availability of the compliance capabilities does rely on the correct subscription level. To learn more, read [Overview of security and compliance in Teams](security-compliance-overview.md). For a detailed list of features available in each subscription, see the [Office 365 Platform Service Description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-365-platform-service-description.aspx).

**Cloud voice features**: For Audio Conferencing, your organization will need to buy and assign an Audio Conferencing license to each user who will be setting up dial-in meetings. For Calling Plans, each user will need a Phone System plus a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

All supported subscription plans are eligible for access to the Teams web client, desktop clients, and mobile apps.

Teams isn't available as a standalone service.

> [!TIP]
> To manage user-level licensing, see [Manage user access to Microsoft Teams](user-access.md).
