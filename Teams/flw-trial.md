# Teams for frontline workers trial overview

The Microsoft Teams Frontline Trial experience lets users in your organization who have Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and aren't licensed for Teams initiate a Teams experience designed for frontline workers. Admins can switch this feature on or off for users in their organization.

## Eligibility

> [!NOTE]
> This offer isn't available for GCC, GCC High, DoD, or EDU customers.

Users can start a frontline trial for their team if they:

- Belong to an organization within the trial pilot.
- Have an active license that gives them access to Teams.
- Haven't previously started a frontline worker trial.

Users can participate in a frontline worker trial if they have a managed Azure Active Directory domain email address.

Users are ineligible to participate if they:

- Currently have Microsoft Teams from a paid or trial license.
- Previously held a trial license.

> [!NOTE]
> 

## Set up the trial

Eligible users can start a Frontline Trial by signing into Teams from the desktop or [web](https://teams.microsoft.com). At this time, starting a Frontline Trial through mobile is not supported. When a trial is initiated, the entire team will be assigned the Frontline Trial license automatically. The user who started the trial will receive email notifications throughout the course of the trial. [Learn users can start and manage a trial](link to end user docs).
