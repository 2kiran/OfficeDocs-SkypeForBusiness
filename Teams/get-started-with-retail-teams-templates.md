# Create a team using retail team templates

Microsoft team templates allow you to quickly and easily create teams by providing a predefined template of settings, channels, and pre-installed apps.

Team templates have pre-built definitions of team structures designed around retailer needs. You can use team templates to quickly create the types of teams that work well for retailers and deploy them across your organization. You can also extend the team templates to create teams that are tailored to your specific organizational needs.

In this article, we'll introduce each of the team templates and recommend how to use them.

This article is for you if you're responsible for planning, deploying, and managing multiple teams across your retail organization. You've already deployed Teams service in your organization. If you haven't yet rolled out Teams, start by reading the [How to roll out Microsoft Teams](./deploy-overview.md).

To learn more about team templates in general, refer to [Get started with team templates](get-started-with-teams-templates.md).

| Who | Method to use: |
| ---- | --------- |
| Admins and IT Professionals | [Use the Teams admin center](#use-the-team-templates-in-the-teams-admin-center) to create teams based on the retail team templates.|
| Developers and systems integrators | [Use the Microsoft Graph](#use-the-team-templates-with-the-microsoft-graph) to create teams based on the retail team templates. |

## Use the team templates in the Teams admin center

### Organize a store

Bring your retail employees together in one central experience to manage tasks, share documents and resolve customer issues. Integrate additional applications to streamline shift start & end processes.

| Base template type |baseTemplateId | Properties that come with this base template |
| ------------------|-- |----------------------------------------------------- |
|Organize a store|`retailStore`|Channels: <ul><li>General<li>Shift handoff</li><li>Learning</li></ul> Apps: <ul><li>Wiki</li></ul>|
||||

### Manager Collaboration

The Manager Collaboration template is ideal for creating a team for a set of managers to collaborate across stores/regions, etc. For example, if your organization has regions, you might create a Manager Collaboration team for the California Region and include all the store managers in that region, along with the regional manager for that region.

| Base template type| baseTemplateId | Properties that come with this base template |
| ------------------|- |----------------------------------------------------- |
|Retail - manager collaboration|`retailManagerCollaboration` |Channels: <ul><li>General<li>Operations</li><li>Learning</li></ul> Apps: <ul><li>Wiki</li></ul>|
||||

## Use the team templates with the Microsoft Graph

### Store template

The Store template is ideal for creating a team to represent an individual retail store location. Using the Store template, you can create a team for each retail store location in your organization.

| Base template type | baseTemplateId | Properties that come with this base template |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Retail - <br>Store | `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/`<br>`teamsTemplates('retailStore')`| Channels <ul><li>Shifts handoff\*</li><li>Learning\*</li></ul>\*Auto-favorited channels<br><br>Team properties <ul><li>Team visibility set to Public</li></ul> <br>Member permissions <ul><li>Can't create/update/delete channels </li><li>Can't add/remove apps </li><li>Can't create/update/remove tabs</li><li>Can't create/update/remove connectors</li><ul>|
||||

Recommended ways to customize the Store template for your organization:

- If your organization has departments within each store, add a channel for each department. Adding a channel facilitates communication and collaboration within the department.

- If your organization has any internal websites (for example, a SharePoint site), consider pinning them as tabs in the relevant team channel. Refer to [Get started with team templates](get-started-with-teams-templates.md) for instructions.

### Manager Collaboration template

The Manager Collaboration template is another one of the team templates designed around retailer needs. The Manager Collaboration template is ideal for creating a team for a set of managers to collaborate across stores/regions, and more. For example, if your organization has regions, you might create a Manager Collaboration team for the California Region and include all the store managers in that region, as well as the regional manager for that region.

| Base template type | baseTemplateId | Properties that come with this base template |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Retail - <br>Store | `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/`<br>`teamsTemplates('retailManagerCollaboration')`| Channels <ul><li>Operations\*</li><li>Learning\*</li></ul>\*Auto-favorited channels<br><br>Team properties <ul><li>Team visibility set to Private</li></ul> <br>Member permissions <ul><li>Can create/update/delete channels </li><li>Can add/remove apps </li><li>Can create/update/remove tabs</li><li>Can create/update/remove connectors</li><ul>|
||||

Recommended ways to customize the Manager Collaboration template for your organization:

- If your organization has any internal websites, such as a SharePoint site, that are relevant for managers, consider pinning them as tabs in a relevant team channel. You can take a look at the [Microsoft team Template documentation](get-started-with-teams-templates.md) for instructions.

## How to use first-party templates

To use these templates, change the 'template@odata.bind' property in the request body from 'standard' to the TemplateIDs above.  For more information on how to deploy team templates, see the Microsoft Graph article on how to [create a Team](/graph/api/team-post?view=graph-rest-beta).

> [!NOTE]
> The channels in the template will automatically be created under the General Tab.

### Example: Store template extension script

``` PowerShell
{
  "template@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teamsTemplates('retailStore')",
  "DisplayName": "Contoso Store",
  "Description": "Team for all staff in Contoso Store",
  "Channels": [
    {
      "displayName": "Additional store channel",
      "IsFavoriteByDefault": false
    }
  ]
}
```
