# Teams PowerShell Module - Supported Versions

Teams PowerShell Module â€“ versions older than 3.0.0 to be retired!



## Current organizations

Starting April 1, 2022, we will be retiring all Teams PowerShell Module versions older than 3.0.0.  This change means that the Administrators will not be able to use Teams PowerShell Module versions released before 3.0.0. 

Instead, we recommend updating Teams PowerShell Module to version 3.0.0 or above.

Important notes:
- Release notes for all the Teams PowerShell Module versions can be found at [Teams PowerShell release notes](teams-powershell-release-notes.md).

- To update any PowerShell module, you should use the same method used to install the module. For example, if you originally used Install-Module, then you should use [Update-Module](/powershell/module/powershellget/update-module) to get the latest version.  

  ```powershell
  Update-Module MicrosoftTeams
  ```

-	If updating from Teams PowerShell Module version 1.1.6 - update your scripts to use `Connect-MicrosoftTeams` instead of `New-CsOnlineSession`.



## New organizations

Organizations newly onboarding to Teams will only be able to use Teams PowerShell Module 3.0.0 or above starting from February 15, 2022.
