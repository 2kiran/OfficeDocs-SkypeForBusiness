# Use financial team templates in the Teams admin center

## OLD

Team templates allow you to quickly and easily create teams by providing a predefined template of settings, channels, and pre-installed apps.

Team templates have pre-built definitions of team structures designed around financial needs. You can also extend the team templates to create teams that are tailored to your specific organizational needs.

In this article, we'll introduce each of the team templates and recommend how to use them.

This article is for you if you're responsible for planning, deploying, and managing multiple teams across your financial organization. You've already deployed Teams service in your organization. If you haven't yet rolled out Teams, start by reading the [How to roll out Microsoft Teams](./deploy-overview.md).

To learn more about team templates in general, refer to [Get started with team templates](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md).

Teams includes templates designed for financial services organizations. Use these pre-built templates to quickly create teams for staff to communicate and collaborate. In this article, we introduce you to each of these templates and recommend how to use them.

## Manage team templates in the Teams admin center

As an admin, you can manage team templates in the Microsoft Teams admin center. Here, you can view details about each template. You can also [create and assign templates policies](templates-policies.md) to your staff to control which templates they see in Teams for [creating teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-team-from-a-template-a90c30f3-9940-4897-ab5b-988e69e4cd9c). To learn more about team templates in general, see [Get started with team templates in the Teams admin center](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md).

We currently offer the following pre-built team templates for financial services organizations. To view them, in the left navigation of the Teams admin center, go to **Teams** > **Team templates**.
