# Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Microsoft 365 or Office 365

Read this topic for information on how to deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Microsoft 365 or Office 365, where Microsoft Teams and Exchange are both online.

## Requirements

Before you deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Microsoft 365 or Office 365, be sure you have met the requirements. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](requirements.md).

### Add a resource account

1. Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

2. In Exchange Online PowerShell, create a new room mailbox or modify an existing room mailbox. By default, room mailboxes don't have associated accounts, so you'll need to add an account when you create or modify a room mailbox that allows it to authenticate with Microsoft Teams.

   - To create a new room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID <Office365 ID> -Name <String> -Alias ConferenceRoom01 -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true  -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```
     This example creates a new room mailbox with the following settings:

     - Account: ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com
  
     - Name: ConferenceRoom01

     - Alias: ConferenceRoom01

     - Account password: P@$$W0rd5959

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com -Name "ConferenceRoom01" -Alias ConferenceRoom01 -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true  -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'P@$$W0rd5959' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   - To modify an existing room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity <RoomMailboxIdentity> -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

     This example enables the account for the existing room mailbox that has the alias value ConferenceRoom02, and sets the password to 9898P@$$W0rd. Note that the account will be ConferenceRoom02@contoso.com because of the existing alias value.

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity ConferenceRoom02 -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '9898P@$$W0rd' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/new-mailbox) and [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-mailbox).

3. In Exchange Online PowerShell, configure the following settings on the room mailbox to improve the meeting experience:

   - AutomateProcessing: AutoAccept (Meeting organizers receive the room reservation decision directly without human intervention.)

   - AddOrganizerToSubject: $false (The meeting organizer is not added to the subject of the meeting request.)

   - DeleteComments: $false (Keep any text in the message body of incoming meeting requests.)

   - DeleteSubject: $false (Keep the subject of incoming meeting requests.)

   - RemovePrivateProperty: $false (Ensures the private flag that was sent by the meeting organizer in the original meeting request remains as specified.)

   - AddAdditionalResponse: $true (The text specified by the AdditionalResponse parameter is added to meeting requests.)

   - AdditionalResponse: "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!" (The additional text to add to the meeting request.)

   This example configures these settings on the room mailbox named ConferenceRoom01.

   ``` PowerShell
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "ConferenceRoom01" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!"
   ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CalendarProcessing](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-calendarprocessing).

4. Connect to MS Online PowerShell to make Active Directory settings by running the `Connect-MsolService` PowerShell cmdlet. For details about Active Directory, see [Azure ActiveDirectory (MSOnline) 1.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0).

   > [!NOTE]
   > [Azure Active Directory PowerShell 2.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0) is not supported.

5. Set the password to never expire by using the following syntax:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN> -PasswordNeverExpires $true
   ```

   <!--
   ```PowerShell
   Set-AzureADUserPassword -UserPrincipalName <Account> -EnforceChangePasswordPolicy $false
   ```  -->

   This example sets the password for the account ConferenceRoom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com to never expire.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com" -PasswordNeverExpires $true
   ```

   <!-- 
   ```PowerShell
   Set-AzureADUserPassword -UserPrincipalName "Rigel1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -EnforceChangePasswordPolicy $false
   ``` -->

   You can also set a phone number for the account by running the following command:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN> -PhoneNumber <phone number>
   ```

   <!-- 
   ```PowerShell
   Set-AzureADUser -UserPrincipalName <Account> -PhoneNumber "<PhoneNumber>"
   ```  -->

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the password is not set to Never Expire, the account will no longer sign in on the device when the account reaches the expiry period. The password will then need to be changed for the account and also updated locally on Teams Rooms. Users are unable to join meetings on Teams Rooms while the password is expired.

6. The resource account needs to have a valid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license, or Exchange and Microsoft Teams will not work. If you have the license, you need to assign a usage location to your resource accountâ€”this determines what license SKUs are available for your account. You can use `Get-MsolAccountSku` <!-- Get-AzureADSubscribedSku --> to retrieve a list of available SKUs for your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization as follows:

   ```Powershell
   Get-MsolAccountSku
   ```

   <!--
   ```Powershell
   Get-AzureADSubscribedSku | Select -Property Sku*,ConsumedUnits -ExpandProperty PrepaidUnits
   ```  -->

   Next, you can add a license using the `Set-MsolUserLicense` <!--Set-AzureADUserLicense --> cmdlet. This example adds the Meeting Room license to the account:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com" -UsageLocation "US"
   Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName "ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com" -AddLicenses "Contoso:MEETING_ROOM"
   ```

   <!-- 
   ```Powershell
   Set-AzureADUser -UserPrincipalName "Rigel1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -UsageLocation "US"
   Set-AzureADUserLicense -UserPrincipalName "Rigel1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -AddLicenses "Contoso:MEETING_ROOM"
   ```   -->

   For detailed instructions, see [Assign licenses to user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell#use-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

   You can also add Phone System capabilities to this account, but you have to configure it first. See [What is Phone System?](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) for more details. This example adds the PSTN Domestic and International Calling Plan:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com -AddLicenses "Contoso:MCOPSTN2"
   ```


## Validate

For validation, you should be able to use any Microsoft Teams client to sign in to the account you created.
