# Enrolling in the Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium (MTRP) managed service

To enroll a Microsoft Teams Rooms account into Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium (MTRP) managed service, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Teams Rooms Premium portal](https://portal.rooms.microsoft.com/) with the same administrator privileges as that used to log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
1. Choose **Settings > Roles** in the left navigation pane to assign a **Managed Service Administrator**.  

This **Managed Service Administrator** will own the day-to-day management and monitoring of the MTRP-managed services portal.

For information on what instructions the **Managed Service Administrator** needs to follow, and how to access them, see [Managed Service Administrator tasks](#managed-service-administrator-tasks).

## Managed Service Administrator tasks

The **Managed Service Administrator** must click on**?** icon at the top right-hand corner of the portal, to launch the **Help** menu.

The **Help** menu provides a [Link to Installation guide](#link-to-installation-guide) that contains instructional content. For information on what the **Installation guide** contains, see [Link to Installation guide](#link-to-installation-guide).

The **Help** menu also contains links that provide information on the Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium monitoring agent.

### Link to Installation guide

The **Help** menu provides a link to the **Installation guide** which in turn provides the following information:

- Instructions on URLs that need to be allowlisted to serve to allow room telemetry to be sent to the managed service.
- Instructions for applying the Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium monitoring agent to a device that is enrolled in the managed service.
