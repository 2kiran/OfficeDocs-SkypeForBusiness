# Standards and Room planner
Using smart recommendations from your environment, you can build and curate standards. You can then publish your standards to a region, site, building, or a specific meeting room to share planned rooms with partners to track room deployments.

### View meeting room types

On this page, you can view room or meeting space types within your organization. A quick break down of how many standards you have for meeting rooms, how many new devices were discovered and number of devices that require an action to be taken.

This page also has a command bar from where you can launch the “create standard” workflow or navigate to Discovered Devices, Change logs & Archive.

## Room Planner wizard

Plan with standards for meetings expansion.

Select *Plan Rooms* to launch the room planner with guided experience.

![Graphical user interface, application, table description](../media/standards-and-room-planner-003.png)

Add rooms to the planner from your location directory.

![Graphical user interface, application description](../media/standards-and-room-planner-003.png)

Two options to set your standards assignment preferences.

- If you have a planning partner on record, you can select “Have my partner assign the best solution for all of these rooms”.  - This option makes it so the partner selects the best locally found solution for their customer.

- If you plan meetings expansion in-house, select "‘Organization admin will assign the best solution for all rooms using organization standards”. The standards are automatically assigned from what has been approved and published by the organization in the Standards view.

-click Organization admin will assign the best solution....

![Graphical user interface, text, application, Word, email description](../media/standards-and-room-planner-003.png)

You can bulk assign standards to multiple rooms

If you have more than one standard available for a location, region or site, you can use the drop down to select a standard you choose to assign for a meeting room.

![Graphical user interface, application description](../media/standards-and-room-planner-003.png)

Review the standard assignments and finish the plan. You can print the plan to PDF to share with partners.
