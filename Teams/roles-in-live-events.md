Presenter, producer, and attendee capabilities in a Teams live event
======================================================

Microsoft Teams supports live events that stream to large online audiences. While the attendee role is passive, the live event presenter and producer have access to several meeting features, including:  

- Chat (includes photos and stickers)
- Recording
- Files
- Q/A

This article describes the available capabilities in a Teams live event.

## Presenter and producer

Presenter and producer include the following:

- Presenters from my organization
- Presenters from other organizations. Presenters are designated by the producer and require a personal invite from the producer.

Presenters and producers have access to all live event features.
