# Get help from a Microsoft reseller or partner

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article is applicable to Teams Phone **without** Calling Plan only. Before reading this article, check [Country and region availability for Teams Phone](/microsoftteams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md) to see whether your country or region supports Teams Phone with Calling Plan.
>
> If your tenant is located in a country or region that supports Teams Phone with Calling Plan, check out [Set up Teams Phone with Calling Plan for small and medium businesses](set-up-overview.md).

To set up Teams Phone without Calling Plan, we recommend that you use a Microsoft partner or seller.

Find a Microsoft reseller or partner, by visiting the [Connect with partners](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-dir) page.

A Microsoft partner or reseller can:

- Obtain the correct Teams Phone licenses for your tenant and phone users
- Help you understand the technical requirements for setting up Teams Phone
- Coordinate with your telephone provider to make sure your phone numbers are properly set up for use with Teams Phone
- Set up communication between your on-premises telephony hardware and Microsoft 365
- Help you set up Teams Phone features like Call Queues, Auto Attendant, Voice Mail, and more

When contacting a Microsoft partner or reseller about setting up Teams Phone without Calling Plan, you'll need to provide them with information such as:

- How many users, phones, and other devices, will need to make and receive calls to and from external phone numbers
- Details about your existing phone system
- Details about your connection between your Microsoft Teams Phone and your PSTN provider
- Your Internet connection
- Unique design considerations about your organization such as the need to support call centers, phone system call menus (for example, press 1 for Sales, press 2 for Technical Support), conference rooms, phone kiosks, and so on.
- How many locations your existing phone system supports and how connectivity is set up between them
