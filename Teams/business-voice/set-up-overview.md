# Set up Microsoft 365 Business Voice

Business Voice is a complete phone system that can replace your existing telephony provider. Whether you're a new business setting up phone numbers for the first time, or an established business moving from a legacy on-premises telephony provider, the steps in these articles can help you get up and running with Business Voice. When you're finished setting up Business Voice:

* You'll be able to receive toll or toll-free phone calls on a main company phone line. You can even set up a call menu if you want.
* Users set up with Business Voice will have their own direct-dial phone numbers that they can use to make and receive phone calls from any device with Teams installed.
* Meeting participants will be able to call in to meetings using a regular phone if they're unable to join from a Teams client.
* If you have existing phone numbers, you'll be able to continue using them after they're moved to Business Voice.
