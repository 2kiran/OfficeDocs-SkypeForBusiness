## Who in my organization needs to be assigned Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses?

To get Phone System with Calling Plan bundled capabilities, users need to be assigned Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses.

Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses include:

- **Teams Phone System** for PBX capabilities like call queues, auto attendants, and call menus.
- A **Microsoft Domestic Calling Plan** that lets users call and receive calls from phone numbers in their country or region.

Users who don't need to make or receive phone calls to or from external phone numbers just need Teams.

For example, you might have ten factory employees and five office employees. The factory employees may only need to call other employees within your company. In addition to calling other employees, office workers need to make and receive phone calls to and from suppliers, partners, and customers. In this case, only the five office workers need Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses.
