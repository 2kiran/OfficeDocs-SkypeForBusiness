# Step 3: Assign Business Voice licenses

Each user that needs to use Microsoft 365 Business Voice needs to be assigned licenses for Business Voice.

1. In the left navigation pane, go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">**Billing** > **Licenses**</a>.
1. Select **Microsoft 365 Business Voice**.
1. On the product details page, select **Assign licenses**.
1. In the **Assign licenses to users** pane, begin typing a name, and then choose it from the results to add it to the list. You can add up to 20 users at a time.
1. When you're finished, select **Assign**, then select **Close**.
