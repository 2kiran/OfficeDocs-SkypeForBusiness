# Assign Business Voice phone numbers to your users

Before users can use Teams to make or receive phone calls to or from regular phone lines, you need to assign phone numbers to them. In Microsoft Teams, the phone number that you assign is listed when a user clicks **Calls**. Do the following for each user that needs a phone number.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see any phone numbers, please wait. It may take several hours for your new phone numbers to become available in Teams.

1. In the left navigation, click **Voice** > **Phone numbers**.
2. On the **Phone numbers** page, select an unassigned number in the list, and then click **Edit**.  
3. In the **Edit** pane, under **Assigned to**, search for the user by display name or user name, and then click **Assign**.
4. To assign or change the associated emergency location, under **Emergency location**, search for and then select the location.
5. Make sure **Email user with telephone number information** is selected so the user receives a welcome email with their new phone number.
6. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Because of the latency between Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and Teams, it can take up to 24 hours for users to be enabled.
