# Set up a Microsoft 365 Business Voice resource account

In Microsoft Teams, a resource account is required for each auto attendant or call queue. Resource accounts may also be assigned service telephone numbers. This is how you assign phone numbers to auto attendants and call queues allowing callers from outside Teams to reach the auto attendant or call queue.

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Org-wide settings**, and then click **Resource accounts**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. In the **Add resource account** pane, fill out **Display name**, **Username**, and the **Resource account type**. The resource account type can be either **Auto attendant** or **Call queue**, depending how you intend to use this resource account.
4. Click **Save**.
