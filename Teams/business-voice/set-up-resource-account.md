# Step 4: Set up a Business Voice resource account

In Microsoft Teams, a resource account is required for each auto attendant or call queue. Resource accounts may also be assigned service telephone numbers. This is how you assign phone numbers to auto attendants and call queues allowing callers from outside Teams to reach the auto attendant or call queue.

## Obtain virtual user licenses

Resource accounts require a license in order to work with auto attendants and call queues. You can use a free *Microsoft 365 Phone System - Virtual User* license.

1. Open the Microsoft 365 admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin (this is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365).
2. In the left navigation pane, go to <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/catalog" target="_blank">**Billing** > **Purchase services**</a> > **Add-ons** > **See all Add-ons products**.
3. Scroll to the end to find the **Microsoft 365 Phone System â€“ Virtual User** license. Select **Details**, then **Buy**.
4. On the license purchase page, select the number of virtual user licenses you want. You need one virtual license for each auto attendant and call queue you plan to set up. We recommend selecting at least five licenses so you can easily set up more auto attendants and call queues in the future without having to purchase more licenses right away.
5. Uncheck **Automatically assign to all of your users with no licenses**.
6. Select **Check out now**.
7. Confirm your order, select **Next**, and then **Place order**.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind you must still  **Buy** the license even though it has a cost of zero.

## Create a resource account

After you've received your *Microsoft 365 Phone System - Virtual User* license, you can create your resource account.
