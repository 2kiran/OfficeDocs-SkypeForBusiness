# Set up a Business Voice resource account

In Microsoft Teams, a resource account is required for each auto attendant or call queue. Resource accounts may also be assigned service telephone numbers. This is how you assign phone numbers to auto attendants and call queues allowing callers from outside Teams to reach the auto attendant or call queue.

## Obtain virtual user licenses

Resource accounts require a license in order to work with auto attendants and call queues. You can use a free *Microsoft 365 Phone System - Virtual User* license.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Add-ons**
3. Scroll to the end to find the **Microsoft 365 Phone System â€“ Virtual User** license. Select **Buy now**.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind you must still  **Buy** the license even though it has a cost of zero.

## Create a resource account

After you've received your *Microsoft 365 Phone System - Virtual User* license, you can create your resource account.

2. Click **Add**.

4. Click **Save**.
