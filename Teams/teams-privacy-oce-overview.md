# Overview of optional connected experiences in Microsoft Teams

If you have a work or school account, your organization's admin may have provided you with the ability to use one or more cloud-backed services (also referred to as **optional connected experiences**) while using Microsoft Teams, like GIPHY, URL Preview service, Paste Image Download, and/or UserVoice. These cloud-backed services are optional. Whether you use them is up to you. They're offered to you under  terms that differ from the [Microsoft Online Service Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products), as described separately for each optional service. This article lists our Teams cloud-backed services.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, see the [Manage privacy controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/privacy/manage-privacy-controls) article to learn how to give or restrict your users' ability to use optional connected experiences.

## GIPHY

GIPHY is a cloud-backed service that lets you use GIFs in your Teams chats. If you’re in **Teams** > **GIF** > **Search**, the search terms are sent to GIPHY. These experiences, if allowed by your admin and after you choose to use them, are subject to the [GIPHY Privacy Policy](https://support.giphy.com/hc/articles/360032872931-GIPHY-Privacy-Policy) and [Terms of Service](https://support.giphy.com/hc/articles/360020027752-GIPHY-User-Terms-of-Service).

## URL Preview service

The URL Preview service automatically generates a preview snippet and attaches under the snippet the URL when a user sends a URL string. This service will make a request to the service URL as the user is typing the message.

## Paste image download

Paste image download allows you to paste an image into a Teams chat by selecting an image on the Internet, using **copy image** or **copy image link**, and pasting the image into a destination Teams chat. If the admin configuration settings don’t allow for content from third-party sources the image will be stripped, and the user will see an error message alerting user of the policy settings. If the Paste image download experience is allowed by your admin, and you choose to use it, you're subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service dependent upon where the image and website used to take the image from. Because there are an ever-growing number of websites that can provide this content, there isn't any way for Microsoft to represent which Privacy Policy or Terms of Service might be applicable. This service will make a request to the service URL as the user is typing the message.

## Suggest a Feature

Suggest a Feature is an experience that allows you to submit your ideas regarding your use of Teams. If you’re in **Teams** > **Help** > **Suggest a Feature**, choosing this option will give you the ability to provided feedback directly to a third-party service called UserVoice. If allowed by your admin to submit ideas using Suggest a Feature, the [terms of service](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/tos) and [privacy policy](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/tos#privacy-policy) of UserVoice will apply.
