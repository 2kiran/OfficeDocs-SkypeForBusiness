# Data transfers between carriers and Microsoft for Operator Connect

## Provisioned and Assigned Numbers

To ensure the proper functioning of the Operator Connect program, Microsoft will inform each participating carrier, through an API, which of the carrierâ€™s phone numbers have been assigned within the Teams admin center, as well as the SIP URI (Session Initiation Protocol Uniform Resource Identifiers) of that phone number.

## Call Detail Records and Quality Data

Microsoft will provide call detail records and quality data to each participating carrier through an API. This is necessary for Microsoft and the carrier to perform troubleshooting and ensure the proper functioning of the service.

## Call Duration Data

Each carrier will provide to Microsoft, through an API, the duration of calls placed by their customers using Microsoft Teams. Microsoft will use these records to provide customers with usage information and to ensure our records are consistent with that of the carrier. Microsoft will store and process these records in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the Microsoft Privacy Statement.
