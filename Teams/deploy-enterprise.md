# Teams enterprise setup

If you're a medium or large business, you need to think about how you're going to roll out the service to your users, how you're going to deploy the Microsoft Teams client to them, how your network design could impact the quality of real-time communication, and so on. Check out the following sections for pointers to articles that'll help you plan for, and roll out, Teams in your organization.


## Architecture

Teams is tightly integrated into Microsoft 365 and uses many features to power chat, file sharing, meetings, telephony, video streaming, and more. Before you roll out Teams, check out [Microsoft Teams IT architecture and telephony solutions posters](teams-architecture-solutions-posters.md) to get familiar with how Teams works with the rest of Microsoft 365 to create a complete collaboration experience for your users.

## Teams advisor

The Teams advisor is a solution within Teams that brings together teams, channels, file sharing, and Planner, to create a deployment project for your organization. Teams advisor creates project plan, specific to the workload you select (such as chat, teams, and channels), that includes the recommended tasks you should perform during your deployment. Each task contains instructions, suggestions, and links to relevant articles, to guide you through the process. You can easily assign tasks to one or more individuals, and specify start and end dates for each task.

For details about how the Teams advisor works, see [Use Advisor for Teams to help you roll out Microsoft Teams](use-advisor-teams-roll-out.md).

(You must be a [Microsoft 365 global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles) to open the Teams advisor)

## Adoption

To ensure that your organization and your users get the most out of Teams, you also need an adoption program. An effective adoption program can mobilize early adopters who can:

- Articulate the benefits of Teams to their colleagues and to business or group leaders.
- Spark excitement in others who see how Teams improves collaboration and makes it easier to connect with each other.
- Help evaluate existing business processes and make recommendations for how Teams can be integrated into them.
- Report back to the deployment team both successes and difficulties to help improve the adoption process.

For details about setting up an adoption program, see [Adopt Microsoft Teams](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).
