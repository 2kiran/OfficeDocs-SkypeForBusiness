Edit guest user information
===========================

To edit guest accounts (such as display name or profile photo), go to your Azure Active Directory portal. For more information, see [Understanding identity and Azure Active Directory](https://support.office.com/article/Understanding-Office-365-Identity-and-Azure-Active-Directory-06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9).

Currently, you can't edit guest information from the Microsoft Teams admin center, the Microsoft 365 admin center, or the Exchange admin center.
