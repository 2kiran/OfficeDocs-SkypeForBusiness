Before you create a Microsoft 365 resource account, check to see what kind of license it needs:

- **Teams meetings** If you want to associate the resource account with a shared device, such as a Microsoft Teams Room or Teams display with hot-desking, and use it to join a Teams meeting so attendees can use it to present video and audio through it, you need a Meeting Room License. For more information about licensing for meeting rooms, see [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](rooms-licensing.md).

- **PSTN calls** If you want the resource to make or receive calls to or from an external phone number (called a Public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN call), you need a Microsoft 365 Phone System or Microsoft 365 Business Voice license. You only need to complete Step 1 in the following overview. Then, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](../teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) for more information.

- If you're only using a resource account to book a resource&mdash;that is, invite the resource to your meeting and have it automatically accept or decline the invitation&mdash;you don't need to assign a license to the resource account and you only need to complete Step 1 in the following overview.  

## Overview

**Step 1 -** [Create a new resource account](#create-a-resource-account). Or, if a room mailbox already exists and you want to convert it to a resource account, you can [modify an existing Exchange room mailbox](?tabs=existing-account#create-a-resource-account).

**Step 2 -**  Then, [configure your account](#configure-mailbox-properties) for Teams Meetings.

**Step 3 -**  If the resource account is going to be associated with a shared device, such as Teams displays with hot-desking, [turn off password expiration](#turn-off-password-expiration).

**Step 4 -**  Lastly, [assign a meeting room license](#assign-a-meeting-room-license) so the account can access Microsoft Teams.

After you create and configure your resource accounts, see [Next steps](#next-steps) to review additional setup tasks, including distribution groups, network capability, and calling.
