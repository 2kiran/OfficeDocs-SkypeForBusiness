Before you create a Microsoft 365 resource account, check to see what kind of license it needs:

- **Teams meetings** If you want to associate the resource account with a shared device, such as a Microsoft Teams Room or Teams display with hot-desking, and use it to join a Teams meeting so attendees can use it to present video and audio through it, you need a Meeting Room License. For more information about licensing for meeting rooms, see [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](rooms-licensing.md).

- **PSTN calls** If you want the resource to make or receive calls to or from an external phone number (called a Public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN call), you need a Microsoft 365 Phone System or Microsoft 365 Business Voice license. You only need to complete Step 1 in the following overview. Then, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](../teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) for more information.

- If you're only using a resource account to book a resource&mdash;that is, invite the resource to your meeting and have it automatically accept or decline the invitation&mdash;you don't need to assign a license to the resource account and you only need to complete Step 1 in the following overview.
