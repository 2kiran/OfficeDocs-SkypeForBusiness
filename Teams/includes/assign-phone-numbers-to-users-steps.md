1. Open the Microsoft Teams admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.
2. In the left navigation pane, go to [**Voice** > **Phone numbers**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/phone-numbers).
3. On the **Phone numbers** page, select an unassigned number in the list, and then click **Edit**.  
4. In the **Edit** pane, under **Assigned to**, search for the user by display name or user name, and then click **Assign**.
5. Under **Emergency location**, you can select either an emergency location you've already created or create a new location for another office by selecting **Add a location**.
6. Decide whether to send a welcome email with phone number information to the user. If you want to:
    - **Bring your existing phone numbers** to Phone System (called phone number porting), *unselect* **Email user with telephone number information**.
    - **Use the new phone numbers** selected by Phone System, *select* **Email user with telephone number information**.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Repeat the above steps for each user to which you want to assign a phone number.

> [!NOTE]
> After assigning a Microsoft Calling Plan to a user, it can take up to 24 hours before they will see the dial pad in their Teams client. If the dial pad is not shown in 24 hours, check your [dial pad configuration](/microsoftteams/dial-pad-configuration). If necessary, you can also [contact support](/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products).
