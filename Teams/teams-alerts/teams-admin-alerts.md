# Microsoft Teams Monitoring and Alerting

New monitoring and alerting capabilities for Microsoft Teams are available in the Microsoft Teams admin center. You can use different sets of rules availble under 'Notifications and Rules' section in Teams admin center to proactively monitor various Teams capablities, and you can be alerted if anything goes wrong with them. For example, you can actively monitor the health of Teams devices (IP Phones, collaboration bars, etc.) if they unexpectedly go offline.  

Your organization can use Teams monitoring and alerting to automatically manage Teams capabilities, be alerted if they show something unexpected, and take corrective actions to get things back on-track.

## How to manage Monitoring and Alerting

To configure alerting rules, you must be a global admin in Microsoft 365 or a Teams service admin. To learn more about Teams admin roles and which reports each admin role can access, see [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md).

Go to the Microsoft Teams admin center, and in the left navigation select **Notifications & alerts**. Under **Rules** choose the rule you want to configure.
