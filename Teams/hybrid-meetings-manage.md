# Step 7 - Manage and monitor your Teams meeting space

Once you've completed setup of your Teams Rooms space, you can switch management and monitoring of the devices in that space. You can make configuration updates remotely, push updates to Teams Rooms consoles, monitor call quality, and more. Use the information in this article to manage and monitor your Teams Rooms consoles and their peripherals.

> This article assumes you purchased a Teams Rooms Pro license for your Teams Rooms console. The Teams Rooms Pro license enables more advanced remote management and analytics for Teams Rooms consoles.
