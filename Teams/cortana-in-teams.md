# Cortana voice assistance in Teams

> [!Note]
> Cortana voice assistance is supported on Microsoft Teams iOS and Android mobile apps only for users in the United States. It isn't currently available for GCC, GCC-High, DoD, EDU tenants. Expansion to additional languages and regions will happen as part of future releases.

Cortana voice assistance in the Teams mobile app enables Microsoft 365 Enterprise users to streamline communication, collaboration, and meeting-related tasks using spoken natural language. Users can speak to Cortana by clicking on the microphone button located in the upper right of the Teams mobile app. To quickly connect with their team while on the go, users can say queries such as &#8220;call Megan&#8221; or &#8220;send a message to my next meeting&#8221;. Users can also join meetings by saying &#8220;join my next meeting&#8221; and use voice assistance to share files, check their calendar, and more. These voice assistance experiences are delivered using [Cortana enterprise-grade services](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/misc/cortana-integration?view=o365-worldwide) that fully comply with Office 365â€™s privacy, security, and compliance promises as reflected in the [Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1).

## Admin control and Limitations

Cortana voice assistance in Teams is delivered using services that fully comply with the Office 365 enterprise-level privacy, security, and compliance promises as reflected in the Online Services Terms (OST). The feature will be enabled by default for tenants.

Tenant admins can control who in their tenant can use Cortana voice assistance in Teams using a policy (TeamsCortanaPolicy). This policy can be set at either a user account level or tenant level. Admins can use the CortanaVoiceInvocationMode field within this policy control to determine whether Cortana is disabled, enabled with push button invocation only, or with wake word invocation as well (applicable to devices that support it).

Admins can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to manage this policy (the policy is currently not available in Microsoft Teams admin center).

- [New-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/New-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy)

- [Get-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy)

- [Grant-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/Grant-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy)

- [Set-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy)

- [Remove-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/Remove-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy)

For example, the command below creates a new policy with name &#8220;EmployeeCortanaPolicy&#8221; where Cortana voice assistant in Microsoft Teams is disabled.  

```PowerShell
PS C:\> New-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy -Identity EmployeeCortanaPolicy -CortanaVoiceInvocationMode Disabled
```

This example shows updating an existing policy with name &#8220;EmployeeCortanaPolicy&#8221; and enabling Cortana voice assistant in Microsoft Teams with push button invocation only. Users will be able to invoke Cortana by tapping on the Cortana mic button in Teams. Wake word (&#8220;Hey Cortana&#8221;) invocation will be disabled.  

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy -Identity EmployeeCortanaPolicy -CortanaVoiceInvocationMode PushToTalkUserOverride
```

This example shows updating the policy and enabling Cortana voice assistant with both push button and wake-word invocation.

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Set-CsTeamsCortanaPolicy -Identity EmployeeCortanaPolicy -CortanaVoiceInvocationMode WakeWordPushToTalkUserOverride
```

> [!Note]
> At the time of the initial release for Microsoft 365 Enterprise users in the US in English, the Teams mobile app will not support wake word activation, but it will be supported in the future.

## User control

Individual users can try out Cortana voice assistance in the Teams mobile app by clicking the microphone button. They can also control whether Cortana in Teams is enabled for their device using a setting in the Teams mobile app.

1. Open the Teams mobile app.

2. Go to **Settings**.

3. Select **Cortana**.

4. Move the toggle to **On** or **Off**, depending on whether you want Cortana voice assistance on the device.
