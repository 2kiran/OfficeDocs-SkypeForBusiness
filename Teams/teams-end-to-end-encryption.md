# End-to-end encryption in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Teams service model, and its encryption support, is subject to change in order to improve customer experiences. For example, the service regularly deprecates cipher suites that are no longer considered secure. Any such changes would be made with the goal of keeping Teams secure and Trustworthy by Design. In addition, all customer content in Microsoft datacenters is encrypted. For information about encryption layers in Microsoft 365, see [Encryption in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/compliance/encryption).

End-to-end encryption, or E2EE, is the encryption of information at its origin and decryption at its intended destination without permitting intermediate nodes or parties to decrypt the data.

When both parties in a 1-to-1 VOIP call turn on E2EE, the communication between those two parties in a call is encrypted from end to end. This means that, no other party, including Microsoft, has access to the decrypted conversation.
