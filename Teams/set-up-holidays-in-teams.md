# Set up holidays in Microsoft Teams

You can use the Teams Holidays feature to schedule specific dates and times when people in your organization will be taking time off from work and won't be available. For example, you might create a holiday for the New Years holiday when many of your employees aren't at work.

The holidays you create here are available when you [set up an auto attendant](create-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md), each with its own greeting and call routing settings.

## Create a holiday

To create a holiday:

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Org-wide settings** > **Holidays**.

2. Select **New holiday**.

3. Enter a name for the holiday.

4. Select **Add new date**.

5. Under **Start time**, select the calendar icon and choose the date when you'd like the holiday to begin.

6. Use the drop-down list to select a start time for the holiday.

7. Under **End time**, select the calendar icon and choose the date when you'd like the holiday to end. If the holiday is one day only, this should be the same date as the one you chose under **Start time**.

8. Use the drop-down list to select an end time for the holiday.

9. Optionally, add more dates for recurring holidays.

10. Select **Save**.
