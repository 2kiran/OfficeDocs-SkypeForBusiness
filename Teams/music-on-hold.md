# Music on Hold

When a Microsoft Teams user places an incoming call from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) on hold, the PSTN caller can listen to selected music.

The music that is played is either the default music provided by Microsoft or custom music that you upload and configure. As the tenant administrator, you configure whether Music on Hold is available by creating a Teams calling policy and assigning the policy to the Teams user. 

Note that PSTN callers can listen to Music on Hold in other scenarios as well; for example, when they call into a Cloud Call Queue or when their call is parked by a Microsoft Teams user. These scenarios are not covered or controlled by the features mentioned in this article. 

## Configure Music on Hold

To configure Music on Hold:

1.	In the left navigation of the Teams admin center, go to **Voice > Calling policies**.

2.	On the **Manage policies** tab select one of the existing policies or create a new one.

3.	In the **Music on hold for PSTN callers** field select **Enabled** in the drop-down menu.

You can also configure Music on Hold by using the Teams PowerShell module. In the TeamsCallingPolicy, change the MusicOnHoldEnabledType parameter to Enabled and then grant that policy instance to one or more users.

If a Teams user has a Teams calling policy with Music on Hold set to Disabled, then no music will be played when the Teams user places the call on hold.

## Configure custom music

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available as a Public Preview release.

In addition to playing default music to PSTN callers, you can upload a custom audio file with music or other audio content and configure that audio file to be played to the PSTN caller.
For example a department or organization might want to play a custom announcement or custom music when external PSTN callers are put on hold.  

> [!NOTE]
> You are responsible for independently clearing and securing all necessary rights and permissions to use any music or audio file with your Microsoft Teams service. This may include intellectual property and other rights in any music, sound effects, audio, brands, names, and other content in the audio file from all relevant rights holders. Holders may include artists, actors, performers, musicians, songwriters, composers, record labels, music publishers, unions, guilds, rights societies, collective management organizations, and any other parties who own, control or license the music copyrights, sound effects, audio and other intellectual property rights.

To configure custom Music on Hold, use the PowerShell cmdlets New/Get/Set/Grant/Remove-CsTeamsCallHoldPolicy and Import/Get/Remove-CsOnlineAudioFile in Teams PowerShell module 2.5.0 or later.


1. Ensure that the Teams user has Music on hold for PSTN callers set to Enabled in the Teams calling policy. 

2. Upload the custom audio file.

3. Create a Teams Call Hold policy referencing the custom audio file and assign it to the Teams user.

### Upload the custom audio file

The configuration of custom Music on Hold starts with uploading the audio file. You use the PowerShell cmdlet Import-CsOnlineAudioFile for this purpose. 
An example of uploading an MP3 audio file using the PowerShell interface is shown below:

```PowerShell
C:\> $content = Get-Content "C:\tmp\customMoH1.mp3" -Encoding byte -ReadCount 0
C:\> $AudioFile = Import-CsOnlineAudioFile -FileName "customMoH1.mp3" -Content $content
C:\> $AudioFile
Id            : 56a56961f2794f098a359885ec1454a1
FileName      : customMoH1.mp3
ApplicationId : TenantGlobal
```

### Reference the audio file in a Teams Call Hold Policy

After you have uploaded the audio file, you need to reference the file in a Teams Call Hold Policy by using the Id of the file when you create or set a Teams Call Hold Policy. For example:

```PowerShell
C:\> New-CsTeamsCallHoldPolicy -Identity "CustomMoH1" -Description "Custom MoH using CustomMoH1.mp3" -AudioFileId $AudioFile.Id
```

After you have created the new Teams Call Hold Policy, you can grant it to your users using Grant-CsTeamsCallHoldPolicy as follows:

```PowerShell
C:\> Grant-CsTeamsCallHoldPolicy -PolicyName "CustomMoH1" -Identity user1@contoso.com
```

To get information about your uploaded audio files, use the Get-CsOnlineAudioFile cmdlet.

To remove an uploaded audio file, use the Remove-CsOnlineAudioFile cmdlet. Before removing an audio file, check that you are not using that audio file in a TeamsCallHoldPolicy.
