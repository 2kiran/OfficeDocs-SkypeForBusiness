# Manage phone numbers for your organization

Microsoft has two types of telephone numbers available: 

- [**User numbers**](#user-phone-numbers) also called subscriber numbers, which can be assigned to users in your organization.

- [**Service numbers**](#service-phone-numbers), which are assigned to services such as Audio Conferencing, Auto Attendants, or Call Queues.

You will need to decide:

- Which user locations need new phone numbers from Microsoft?
- Which type of telephone number (subscriber or service) do I need?
- How do I port existing phone numbers to Teams?

How you acquire and manage phone numbers differs depending on your PSTN connectivity option.

- For information about managing phone numbers for Calling Plan, see [Manage phone numbers for Calling Plan](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md).

- For information about managing phone numbers with Operator Connect, see [Set up phone numbers with Operator Connect](operator-connect-configure.md#set-up-phone-numbers).

- For information about managing phone numbers for Direct Routing, see [Configure the phone number and enable enterprise voice and voicemail](direct-routing-enable-users.md#configure-the-phone-number-and-enable-enterprise-voice-and-voicemail-online).

If you need additional or other number types other than those numbers seen in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you can submit a phone number request to the [PSTN service desk](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-pstn-service-desk.md).

## User phone numbers

There are two types of user numbers, which can be assigned to users in your organization:  
    
- **Geographic numbers** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area and are the most common. For example, geographic phone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state, or region of the country.
    
- **Non-geographic numbers** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers that don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region. Also, some countries, such as Denmark, only have non-geographic numbers available.


## Service phone numbers  

**This section describes service numbers available with Microsoft Calling Plans. For information about service numbers for Operator Connect and Direct Routing, contact your provider.**  

**NOTE TO REVIEWERS: DO WE JUST SAY CONTACT PROVIDER?  DO WE PROVIDE INFO IN THIS TOPIC?  OR DO WE PROVIDE INFO IN SEPARATE TOPICS FOR DR AND OC?  DO I FOLLOW UP WITH MATTIA'S TEAM FOR DETAILS?**

There are two types of service phone numbers for Calling Plans--toll and toll-free--which can be assigned to services such as Audio Conferencing, Auto Attendants, or Call Queues. Service numbers have a higher concurrent call capacity than user numbers. Service number availability varies by country/region and the type of number (whether it's a toll or toll-free number).
    
 - **Toll service numbers** - There are two types of toll service numbers, which may incur a toll cost to the caller:
    
   - **Geographic numbers** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area. For example, geographic phone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state, or region of the country.
        
   - **Non-geographic numbers** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers that don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region.
   
- **Toll-free service numbers** These service numbers don't typically incur a toll cost to the caller. Teams provides national toll-free numbers in over 60 countries/regions.
    
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Some countries/regions and originating number types, such as calls originating from mobile phones, may in some cases incur a toll cost to the caller.
