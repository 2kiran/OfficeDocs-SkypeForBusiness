# Supervise chats in Microsoft Teams

Supervise chats allow private teacher-to-student chat, while blocking student-only private chats. Admins manage userâ€™s chat permission settings via Microsoft Teams policies.

Education institutions provide a safe and healthy digital space for students. The digital space includes emails, online meetings and calls, and messaging in Teams.
To prevent inappropriate messaging behavior, many K12 schools disable private chat in Teams. Unfortunately, disabling chat also blocks the opportunity for teachers to reach out to students privately for personalized learning. With chat disabled, students can't reach out to teachers when they prefer not to post the messages publicly in class teams.

## Use cases

- Follow-up that students are not comfortable sharing or asking publicly
- Teacher reaching out a student on an assignment or recent class interaction (or lack of)
- Student-facing staff reaching out to student on school-related matters
- Ad hoc group project in a course monitored by teacher (if it is a pre-structured course projects, private channels would be recommended instead)

## User stories

As an admin:

- I can ensure school is providing a safe collaboration space virtually. I can do so by enabling some settings so that students cannot chat with one another without teachers present.
- I can ensure that co-teachers or teaching assistants can still chat with students with teacher present.
- I can ensure other staff and teachers are still able to chat and communicate with each other freely.

As an educator:

- I can engage with students privately to help improve their learning outcome with personalized teaching, especially for those who are shy in public chats/meetings. I can do so by talk to a student privately, or in a group chat with students, teachers, or teaching assistants (Tas).
- I can feel safe that the engagement is free of disruption, for example, students cannot kick me out of a group chat I set up.
As a student
- I can feel safe to engage with teachers to help improve my learning outcome. I can do so by initiating or replying a chat with teachers.
- I can feel safe in collaboration space virtually with a trust that school provided software where other students will not be able to send me private inappropriate messages related to bullying, suicidal notes, cheating, sexting, or sex predators.

## Permission types

The following permissions are available with supervised chats.

|Title |Permission level|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Supervisor |Full permissions| This is the group of users who can engage in one-on-one or group chats with anyone, including with users who require supervision. In education, anyone who has the permission to chat with students privately would fall under this group: full-time teachers, principals.|
|Supervised user| Restricted permissions| This is the group of users who can engage in one-on-one or group chats only when the supervisors are present in the chat. In education, pre-school and K12 students would most likely fall under this group.|
|Not supervised|Limited permission | This is the group of users who can chat with supervisors or anyone else in this group. But cannot chat with supervised users without a supervisor present.|
