# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

## Which capabilities can I get with add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams capabilities. They give you the flexibility to add capabilities only for users in your organization who need them. To add a capability, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 plan you have. To see which voice options are available to you, see the [Which voice capabilities are available with my plan?](#which-voice-capabilities-are-available-with-my-plan) section of this article.

Here's a list of Teams add-on licenses and their capabilities that you can add to your Teams subscription.

<br/>

|License|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|**Microsoft 365 Business Voice** <br/> | Business Voice was Microsoft's voice capability bundle for small and medium businesses but will be deprecated on March 1, 2022. <br/> <br/> If you're a small or medium-sized business, we recommend purchasing the [Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle](../business-voice/whats-business-voice.md), if it's available in your region. |
|**Teams Phone with Calling Plan** <br/> |The Teams Phone with Calling Plan license is a calling solution that bundles Teams Phone System's PBX capabilities and a Domestic Calling Plan for PSTN connectivity. <br/> |
|**Teams Phone Standard** <br/> |[Teams Phone System](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is a hosted telephone service that gives you call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities. Teams Phone Standard licenses give you all Teams Phone System capabilities like cloud voicemail, caller ID, call park, call forwarding, auto attendants, call queues, call transfer, and caller ID. <br/> <br/>To learn more about Phone System, see [Here's what you get with Teams Phone System](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Teams Phone](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799763).  <br/> |
|**Microsoft Teams Calling Plans** <br/> |If you want users to be able to call phone numbers outside your organization, you can purchase [Teams Calling Plans](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) to connect to PSTN phone numbers. There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans. For pricing info on Teams Calling Plans, see [Pricing for Calling Plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799761 ).  <br/> |
|**Communication Credits** |If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you'll need to [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). Communication Credits provide a monthly pool of minutes that can also be used for PSTN phone calls, if all your Calling Plan minutes get used before the beginning of the next month.<br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Teams meeting instead their computer. [Set up Audio Conferencing](../set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md) for users who schedule or lead meetings. <br/> <br/>To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).  <br/> <br/>Organizations can now use a third-party operator for their Audio Conferencing numbers. See [Plan for Operator Connect Conferencing](../operator-connect-conferencing-plan.md) for more information. <br/>|
|**Microsoft Teams Rooms** <br/> |[Microsoft Teams Rooms](../rooms/index.md) isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md).  <br/> |
|**Advanced Communications** <br/> |[Advanced Communications](advanced-communications.md) includes advanced meetings customization and tools to manage your organization's communication policies. |

## Which voice capabilities are available with my plan?

See what add-on licenses you need to get voice capabilities in Teams, depending on the plan you have.

Depending on the voice capabilities that you want, we recommend comparing whether it's more cost effective for you to switch to a plan that includes those capabilities. For example, for most large organizations, buying a bundle of software in a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with a higher combined cost.

#### [**Small and medium businesses**](#tab/small-business/)

If you're a small or medium-sized business (less than 300 users), you have four ways to get voice capabilities:

- Buy a Microsoft 365 Business plan and add Teams Phone with Calling Plan licenses.
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 plan and add Teams Phone with Calling Plan licenses.
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 plan and add voice capabilities individually.
- Buy an Enterprise E5 plan, which includes voice capabilities.
  - The Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 plan includes Teams Phone System, but organizations still need to choose a [PSTN connectivity option](../pstn-connectivity.md).

If you would like PBX capabilities, you have two options to choose from:

- **Microsoft Teams Phone with Calling Plan license**: Get this if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by Microsoft. Check to see if [Teams Phone with Calling Plan is available in your region](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).
- **Microsoft Teams Phone Standard license**: This license includes Teams Phone System, but you'll still need to connect to the PSTN. To learn about voice solutions, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](../cloud-voice-landing-page.md). To view all your PSTN connectivity options, see [PSTN connectivity options](../pstn-connectivity.md).
- **Microsoft Enterprise E5 plan**: Enterprise E5 plans include Teams Phone System, but you'll still need to connect to the PSTN. 

To learn more, see [Teams Phone guidance for small and medium businesses](../business-voice/whats-business-voice.md).

Here's a summary based on licensing plan.
