# Advanced Communications add-on for Microsoft Teams

If your organization is looking to further enhance your communication experience, get Advanced Communications for advanced meeting customization and tools to manage your organizationâ€™s communication policies.

## What is Advanced Communications?

Advanced Communications provides enhanced calling and meeting capabilities that address a spectrum of communication needs, including the following features:

- **Tailor and customize meetings:** Drive standardization across meetings for your internal and custom-facing scenarios, with features such as custom branded meeting lobby. Implement with flexibility across your organization's departments.
