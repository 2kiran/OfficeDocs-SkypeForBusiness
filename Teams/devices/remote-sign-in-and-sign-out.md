Teams Android devices can be remote signed in and signed out from the Teams admin center. If you haven't provisioned a device yet, or the device is provisioned but has never been signed-in, see [Remote provisioning and sign in for Teams Android devices](remote-provision-remote-login.md).

## Remote sign in

After a device is provisioned and signed in for the first time, it will appear on the **Phones** page of the Teams admin center.

To sign in a device that has been signed out, go to **Devices > Phones**.

1. Select the device you want to sign in.

2. Go to the **Actions** menu, and select **Sign in a user**.
