# Purchase devices in the Teams devices store

The Device Marketplace in the Teams admin center lets you browse and purchase devices certified for Microsoft Teams for your organization.

## Third-party data collection

The Teams device store shares basic user and company information, including user and tenant GUIDs, with UnifiedCommunications.com to enable purchases by you and other admins. Orders placed in the Teams device store and any data associated with them are classified as tenant orders and tenant data.

When **Allow third-party data collection** is on, you allow the shared data to be used as specified in their terms of service and privacy statement.

To opt out of third-party data collection, in the Teams admin center, go to **Teams devices store**, select the settings icon, and turn off **Allow third-party data collection**. When this setting is off, you can browse the Teams devices store, but you can't make purchases.

## Provision devices

Devices that can be remotely provisioned will appear in the Teams admin center **X VALUE TBD** days after you place an order. These devices will already have their MAC addresses added to the Teams admin center.

Once your devices are delivered, see [Remotely provision devices](remote-provision-remote-login.md#generate-a-verification-code) to generate a verification code and complete the provision and sign-in process.

## Partner information

If you're a partner interested in learning more about the Teams device store, contact **EMAIL TBD** for more information.
