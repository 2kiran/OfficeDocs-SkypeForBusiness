# Microsoft Teams panels

Microsoft Teams panels are compact digital display devices that are mounted right outside of your meeting spaces. These touch screen panels are dedicated Microsoft Teams devices that provide at-a-glance view about your meeting space and the scheduled meeting. With the vibrant color-coded LED and Home screen indicators, you can determine if the space is available or reserved even from a distance. You can use Teams panels to reserve an available room for an ad-hoc meeting, on the go.

Teams panels are come pre-integrated with Microsoft Teams and display meeting details that are scheduled through Outlook or Teams calendars. 

This article is intended for both end users and admins, and provides guidance on how to perform different actions right from the mounted Teams panels devices.

This article also provides answers to the frequently asked questions about the Teams panels device.

### Meeting space availability and meeting details pane
The appearance of this pane and its capabilities differ depending on the space availability and type of reservation.

**Meeting space is reserved for a scheduled meeting**  
If the meeting space is reserved for a scheduled meeting (scheduled either via Outlook or Teams), the pane appears in purple and displays meeting title in prominent text, meeting start and end times, and meeting organizer's name.

**Meeting space is reserved for an ad hoc meeting**  
If the meeting space is [reserved for an ad hoc meeting](#reserve-meeting-spaces-for-ad-hoc-meetings), the pane appears in purple and displays **Reserved** in prominent text, and meeting start and end times.

**Meeting space is available**

:::image type="content" source="../media/panels-right-pane-available-status.png" alt-text="This screenshot shows how the Teams panels Home screen appears when the meeting space is available":::

## Reserve meeting spaces for ad hoc meetings

You can reserve an [available meeting space](#meeting-space-is-available) from the panels itself for an ad-hoc meeting. Ad hoc meetings are automatically scheduled as Teams meetings. However, once the meeting space is reserved for an ad-doc meeting, you cannot release or unreserve the meeting space from the panels itself. Only admins of the device's resource account can cancel the meeting (via Outlook or Teams calendar) to unreserve the space.

The start time for an ad-hoc meeting is always the current time and it can be scheduled until the next scheduled meeting or up to 24 hours, whichever is earlier. However, you cannot reserve a meeting space for less than five minutes.
 
To reserve an available meeting space for an ad hoc meeting:

1. On the Home screen, tap the **Reserve** button.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/panels-reserve.png" alt-text="Teams panels Home screen showing the Reserve button":::
2. In the **Ad hoc meeting** pane, review the available end time choices. You can use the right arrow to see additional times.

    > [!Note]

    > - The end time choices are displayed in 15-minute increments.
    > - The default end time depends on the difference between the current time and the next 15-minute interval. If the difference is less than five minutes, the default end time skips the nearest 15-minute interval, instead displays the next. For example, if the current time is 1:57 PM (which is less than five minutes from 2:00 PM), the default end time displays as 2:15 PM, and not 2 PM. This prevents users to schedule meetings for 5 minutes or less.
 
3. Tap the desired end time to select it, and tap **Reserve**

    :::image type="content" source="../media/panels-reserve-endtime.png" alt-text="Ad hoc meeting pane showing end time slots":::

    A confirmation window appears showing a thumbs up emoji, meeting start and end time, and meeting space name. The right pane on the Home screen now appears in purple, displaying **Reserved** text and the Teams logo, to indicate that the space is reserved for a Teams meeting.
