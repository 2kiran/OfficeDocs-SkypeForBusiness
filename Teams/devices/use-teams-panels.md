# Microsoft Teams panels

Microsoft Teams panels are compact digital display devices that are mounted right outside of your meeting spaces. These touch screen panels are dedicated Microsoft Teams devices that provide at-a-glance view about your meeting space and the scheduled meeting. With the vibrant color-coded LED tiles on the Home screen, you can determine if the space is available or reserved even from a distance. You can use Teams panels to reserve an available room for an ad-hoc meeting, on the go.

Teams panels are integrated with Microsoft Exchange and display meeting details that are scheduled through Outlook or Teams calendars. 

This article is intended for both end users and admins, and provides guidance on how to perform different functions right from the mounted Teams panels devices. This article also provides answers to the frequently asked questions about the Teams panels device.
