# Remote provisioning and verification code creation in Microsoft Teams

IT admins can remotely provision and sign in to a Teams device. To provision a device remotely, the admin needs to upload the MAC IDs of the devices being provisioned and create a verification code. The entire process can be completed remotely from the Teams admin center.

## Add a device MAC address

Provision the device by imprinting a MAC address on it.

1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Devices**.
3. Select **Provision new device** from the **Actions** tab.

In the **Provision new devices** window, you can either add the MAC address manually or upload a file.

**Manually add a device MAC address**

1. From the **Awaiting Activation** tab, select **Add MAC ID**.
2. Enter the MAC ID.
3. Enter a location, which helps technicians identify where to install the devices.
4. Select **Apply** when finished.

**Upload a file to add a device MAC address**

1. From the **Awaiting Activation** tab, select **Upload MAC IDs**.
2. Download the file template.
3. Enter the MAC ID and location, and then save the file.
4. **Select file**, and then select **Upload**.

## Generate a verification code

You need a verification code for the devices. The verification code is generated in bulk or at the device level and is valid for 24 hours.

- From the **Awaiting Activation** tab, select an existing MAC ID.

   A password is created for the MAC address and is shown in the **Verification Code** column.

You'll need to provide the list of MAC IDs and verification codes to the field technicians. You can export the detail directly in a file and share the file with the technician who is doing the actual installation work.

## Provision the device

When the device is powered on and connected to the network, the technician provisions the device.

1. The technician selects **Provision device** from the **Settings**.

2. The technician enters the device-specificâ€¯verification code in the provided input field.

 Once the device is provisioned successfully, the tenant name appears on the sign-in page.

## Sign in remotely

1. Select a device from the **Awaiting sign in** tab.
2. Follow the instructions in **Sign in a user**, and then select **Close**.
