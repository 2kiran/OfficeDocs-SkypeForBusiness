# Remote provisioning and sign in for Teams Android devices

IT admins can remotely provision and sign in to a Teams device. To provision a device remotely, the admin needs to upload the MAC IDs of the devices being provisioned and create a verification code. The entire process can be completed remotely from the Teams admin center.

## Review the supported devices

The following list shows the device firmware requirements.

## Add a device MAC address

Complete the following steps to provision a new device.

1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Devices**.
3. Select **Provision new device** from the **Actions** tab.

In the **Provision new devices** window, you can either add the MAC address manually or upload a file.

### Manually add a device MAC address

1. From the **Awaiting Activation** tab, select **Add MAC ID**.
2. Enter the MAC ID.
3. Enter a location, which helps technicians identify where to install the devices.
4. Select **Apply** when finished.

### Upload a file to add a device MAC address

1. From the **Awaiting Activation** tab, select **Upload MAC IDs**.
2. Download the file template.
3. Enter the MAC ID and location, and then save the file.
4. **Select file**, and then select **Upload**.

## Generate a verification code

You need a verification code for the devices. The verification code is generated in bulk or at the device level and is valid for 24 hours.

1. From the **Awaiting Activation** tab, select an existing MAC ID.
   A password is created for the MAC address and is shown in the **Verification Code** column.

2. Provide the list of MAC IDs and verification codes to the field technicians. You can export the detail directly in a file and share the file with the technician who is doing the actual installation work.

## Provision the device

When the device is powered on and connected to the network, the technician provisions the device. These steps are completed on the Teams device.
