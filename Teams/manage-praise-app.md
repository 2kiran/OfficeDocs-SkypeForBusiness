# Manage the Praise app in the Microsoft Teams admin center

> [!NOTE]
> Admins must have a Teams license to access this feature. If you try to access this feature without a Teams license, you'll get an error message.

The Praise app in Microsoft Teams helps users show appreciation to members of their organization or classroom. With a selection of badge sets to choose from, Praise is designed to help recognize the effort that goes into the wide range of work that Teams users do, from educators to Frontline Workers. To learn more, check out [Send Praise to people](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-praise-to-people-50f26b47-565f-40fe-8642-5ca2a5ed261e).

Admins can control what badges are available to their organization from the Microsoft Teams admin center. In the left navigation, go to **Teams apps > Manage apps**. In the list of apps, choose **Praise**, and then select **Settings**.  From here, you can choose to enable default and built-in badge sets.

> [!NOTE]
> The Praise app is available for GCC cloud environment, but not for GCC High or DoD.

## Use built-in badge sets

Built-in sets are collections of badges designed by Microsoft for the Praise app. These sets are not editable by admins. The default badge set is already enabled and available in the Praise app. To change the availability of the default set or of any badges sets, switch the corresponding toggle to On or Off.

### Default badges

The default badge set is designed to help Teams users recognize their peers for going above and beyond with their work.

## Badge set assets

Built-in badge sets can't be modified, so when a built-in set is enabled, all badges in the set are added to the Praise app. If you want to add specific badges from a built-in set and leave out others, re-create the badges you want to use as custom badges. You can download the badge image and find the text and background colors of badges from built-in sets in the tables below.

## Upcoming changes

Starting in January 2022, what's currently available for badges will change. Social and emotional learning badges for education, including self-awareness and self-management, will no longer be available.

The **Create a custom badge**â€¯option will also no longer be available as of January 2022.

Additionally, the **Status** toggle in the Teams admin center that allows or block Praise will affect both the Praise app and the Praise feature in the Viva Insights app in Teams.
