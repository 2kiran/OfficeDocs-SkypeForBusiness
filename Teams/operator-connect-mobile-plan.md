# Plan for Operator Connect Mobile

Operator Connect Mobile is another option for providing Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity with Teams and Phone System. With Operator Connect Mobile, a user’s SIM-enabled phone number is also their Teams phone number. Users can use a single phone number in Microsoft Teams across both their mobile service and desk lines, and seamlessly transition between networks and devices.



You might consider a combination of services. For example, you might choose Operator Connect Mobile for your sales and field organizations who require mobile support, but another solution for your onsite call center organization who rely on desk phones. For more information about Teams voice solutions and PSTN connectivity options, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](cloud-voice-landing-page.md) and [PSTN connectivity options](pstn-connectivity.md). 


This article describes benefits and requirements, and provides a link to the operators participating in the Microsoft Operator Connect Mobie program.  If you decide Operator Connect Mobile is the right solution for your organization, after reading this article, see [Configure Operator Connect Mobile](operator-connect-mobile-configure.md).  

For a list of operators participating in the Microsoft Operator Connect Mobile Program and the countries or regions where their service is available, see the Microsoft 365 Operator Connect Mobile page.

## Benefits

With Operator Connect Mobile, if your existing operator is a participant in the Operator Connect Mobile program, they can manage the service for bringing PSTN calling to Teams. The Operator Connect program provides the following benefits:

- **A single number to work from any location and device.**  Users have one business-provided number for mobile, desk, and Microsoft Teams. Users can work flexibly and securely from any location, device, or network.  

- **Keep your mobile workforce connected securely.** Improve availability and responsiveness of employees by providing tools to work securely from anywhere across devices of your choice using reliable communication solutions with failover options using cellular voice network or internet connections. 

-	**Security, privacy  and compliance capabilities of Teams.** With Operator Connect Mobile, your organization can extend enterprise-grade business policies such as recording and retention to voice calls on native mobile devices. Calls from users’ devices can also be configured to appear as though they’re coming from the organization to avoid exposing users’ mobile numbers externally.

- **Opportunities to streamline support and eliminate redundant services.** Operator Connect Mobile enables organizations to consolidate redundant fixed-line and mobile services, as well as reduce the number of devices and hardware to purchase, manage, and support.

Operator Connect Mobile equips your end users with:

Users can seamlessly move between devices and Teams endpoints without dropping calls or losing context.

- **The power of Teams.** Operator Connect Mobile enables users to seamlessly “uplift” calls to Teams on any device (laptop, tablet, desk phone or mobile phone), creating valuable opportunities to collaborate -- adding video, sharing content, recording and transcription, inviting new participants, and more.

- **True mobile integration.** Give users access to combined call history, unified voice mail and presence fidelity, across Teams and native mobile devices. 


- Implement enterprise-grade business policies that are secure and compiant across mobile devices.

## Features

Operator Connect Mobile users can leverage existing [Phone System features](here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md), as well as new experiences only available to them:

- SIM-Enabled Phone Number Calling With Teams: Make and receive calls from your smartphone’s native dialer or Teams endpoints using your single business owned SIM-enabled mobile number. When you make an outbound call from your Smartphone’s native dialer or any Teams endpoint, you can show either your mobile or a company service number. Incoming calls ring your smartphone native dialer and simultaneously ring active Teams clients.

-	Move Calls between devices and endpoints: Seamlessly move a call from smartphone native dialer to any Teams endpoint without dropping the call. You can move calls from the native dialer to the Teams app on the same device as well as endpoint transfer to another device with Teams. 

- Compliance recording available for native dialer and Teams app calls (If customer has required subscriptions and services).

- Add your SIM-Enabled mobile number as part of companies’ Teams Phone Call Queues and PBX.

- Show mobile number or company’s advertised number as outbound caller id when making outbound calls from the smartphone’s native dialer or any Teams endpoint.

- Ability to Transfer Calls to colleagues for further assistance using Teams app. Users can choose between blind and consultative call transfers. 

- Combined Called History in Teams (irrespective of Teams or phone dialer).

- Presence Integration:  If you are on a call on the native dialer, your status in Teams will update to “In the Call”. 

- Unified Voicemail  & Business Unanswered Settings on all Teams endpoints and email with business enforced archival periods.

- Ability to select whether incoming calls ring the native dialer or the Teams app on the SIM-enabled mobile device.
