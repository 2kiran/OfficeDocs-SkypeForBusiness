# How SharePoint and OneDrive interact with Microsoft Teams

> [!Tip]
> Watch the following session to learn how Teams interacts with Azure Active Directory (AAD), Microsoft 365 Groups, Exchange, SharePoint and OneDrive: [Foundations of Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/teams-foundations)

Each team in Microsoft Teams has a team site in SharePoint, and each standard channel in a team gets a folder within the default team site document library. Each [private channel](private-channels.md) gets its own, separate SharePoint site. To learn more about these team sites and channel sites, see [Manage Teams connected sites and channel sites](/sharepoint/teams-connected-sites).

Files shared within a conversation are automatically added to the document library, and permissions and file security options set in SharePoint are automatically reflected within Teams. To see the impact of changing a site address in SharePoint, read [Change a site address](/sharepoint/change-site-address).

Private chat files are stored in the sender's OneDrive folder, and permissions are automatically granted to all participants as part of the file sharing process.

If users aren't assigned SharePoint licenses, they don't have OneDrive storage in Microsoft 365. File sharing works in standard channels, but users won't be able to share files in chats without OneDrive storage in Microsoft 365.

By storing the files in the SharePoint document library and OneDrive, all compliance rules configured at the organization level will be followed. 

> [!NOTE]
> Integration with SharePoint Server is not supported for Teams.

The following is the example of relationships between team, standard channel, and document library.

For every team, a SharePoint site is created, and the **Shared Documents** folder is the default folder created for the team. Each standard channel, including the **General** channel (the default channel for each team) has a folder in **Shared Documents**.

The default SharePoint site and document library can't be replaced with a different one.

For every user, the OneDrive folder **Microsoft Teams Chat Files** is used to store all files shared within private chats with other users (1:1 or 1:many), with permissions configured automatically to restrict access to the intended user only.

Note that for public teams, the SharePoint team site is provisioned with "Everyone except external users" access. The public team isn't displayed in Teams for people who aren't members of that team. However, they can access content on the SharePoint team site using the URL of the SharePoint team site. 

## Channel Files tab

The **Files** tab in Teams closely resembles the SharePoint documents view. On the **Files** tab, users can:

- See additional options in the **New** file menu.
- Sync files to their local drive.
- On the **All Documents** menu, switch from **List** view to **Compact list** to **Tiles** view.
- Identify files that need attention or have malware.
- Immediately see whether a file is read-only or checked out.
- Check out and check in files.
- Pin, unpin, and change the sort order of files.
- Identify which files need metadata
- Choose from many more filter options.
- Group files based on column headings.
- Modify column settings (move left or right, hide) and column width.

## Default link type setting

The type of sharing link shown by default when a user shared a file is set in the SharePoint admin center. See [Change the default link type when users get links for sharing](/sharepoint/change-default-sharing-link) for information.
