# Troubleshoot low-bandwidth scenarios for Teams

Numerous network elements can affect performance when working with Microsoft Teams.

Consider the following situations:

- Low-speed internet connection for the school.
- Low-speed internet connection for one or more students.
- Times of the day when there's low bandwidth because of network usage in an area.
- Outages local to neither the school nor students, but affect performance.
- Issues with hardware that cause low-bandwidth issues.

This article will give you best practices when dealing with low-bandwidth issues in Teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read [How Microsoft Teams uses memory](teams-memory-usage-perf.md) because you may also have resource issues on devices. If you're looking for Teams network guidance, see [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](prepare-network.md).

## Resolving low-bandwidth issues for IT admins

School-wide solutions for low-bandwidth issues may not resolve problems quickly enough. Some issues may only resolve with a narrow focus taken at the individual user level.

If bandwidth issues occur for many users or if actions taken at the user level haven't been helpful, taking school-wide action is the next step.

> [!NOTE]
> You may also want to read the [Quality of Experience Review Guide](quality-of-experience-review-guide.md). It's not EDU-specific but has valuable information. This guide goes in depth on managing Teams meeting quality.

### Meetings and video

Consider the actions below when dealing with meeting issues related to low network bandwidth.

#### Meeting video policies

Low bandwidth primarily affects video quality in meetings.

Teams automatically scales meeting quality to a user's detected bandwidth. However, you can set further restrictions to preserve bandwidth.

Some restrictions you can set via policy include:

- Turning off video altogether so no one can use video.
- Limiting the media bit rate, which is set per-user.

For more policies you should set for meetings and video, read [Meeting policy settings in Teams: Audio and video](meeting-policies-audio-and-video.md).

#### Screen sharing policies

In Teams, educators can share their entire screen or share individual applications or windows.

Sharing an entire screen uses more bandwidth than just sharing an application or window.

Restricting users from sharing their entire screen can be set via policy.

Alternatively, you can instruct educators to only share applications, not their entire screen.

Learn about screen sharing policies at [Meeting policy settings in Teams: Audio and video](meeting-policies-audio-and-video.md).

#### Dial-in number for meetings

It may be easier for some students to dial in to classroom sessions.

You can provide a dial-in number for Teams meetings as an alternative to attending a video meeting.

For more information, read [Set the phone numbers included on invites in Microsoft Teams](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites-in-teams.md).

## Low-bandwidth scenarios as an educator

Educators should feel empowered to take steps to resolve low-bandwidth issues.

Having educators troubleshoot bandwidth issues may be a superior choice to IT action in the following situations:

- The problem is intermittent.
- There is a specific time of the day you can anticipate there being an issue.

For steps an educator can take to resolve bandwidth issues, read [Use Teams for schoolwork when bandwidth is low](https://support.office.com/article/use-teams-for-schoolwork-when-bandwidth-is-low-5c5675f7-1b55-471a-9daa-ec1e6df38262).

## Low-bandwidth scenarios as a parent or student

Sometimes the bandwidth problem is on a student's side.

Many parents aren't able to troubleshoot these issues, and low-bandwidth issues may be out of a student or parent's control.

- Their home may not have access to high bandwidth.
- They may have many people in their immediate area also consuming bandwidth.
- There may be internet instability.

We've put together guidance in our [Use Teams for schoolwork when bandwidth is low](https://support.office.com/article/use-teams-for-schoolwork-when-bandwidth-is-low-5c5675f7-1b55-471a-9daa-ec1e6df38262) article for parents and students.
