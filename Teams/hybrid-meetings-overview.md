# Create a great Teams meeting experience for all participants

Meetings are a place where people come together to exchange ideas and work on hard problems. In a time when workplace environments are undergoing significant change, it can be challenging to bring people together and enable effective meetings. This solution shows you how can bring together Microsoft Teams, Teams Rooms devices, room design, meeting principles, and business practices, to create an inclusive meeting environment. An inclusive environment enables communication and collaboration between all recipients, regardless of whether they're in the room, remote, or have a disability.

The following sections outline the key steps in this scenario.

## Meeting principles

No matter what technology you use, meeting principles are at the core of inclusive meetings. These principles define how participants of a meeting interact with each other, how information is shared, and how to enable effective collaboration. Use the following principles as the basis for the principles you define for your organization. Review your principles with leaders and individual contributors, in-person and remote, with and without disabilities, across your organization.

Each of these principles helps define the meeting best practices outlined in [Step 2 - Evangelize meeting best practices](hybrid-meetings-educate-remote.md).

### Equality and inclusivity

All participants, whether in-person or remote, expect and deserve to be heard and to be given a chance to participate in collaboration. Participants with disabilities need access to technology and materials that enable them to fully participate in meetings.

To support this principle, in-person and remote participants can use Teams chat for side conversations and Front Row view to see participants in other locations. Participants with disabilities can use meeting transcriptions, recordings, live closed captioning, and more, to participate in, and review, conversations.

### Be seen and heard


To support this principle, all recipients can join the meeting in Teams (even if in the room) and turn on their individual cameras. By using individual cameras, in-room participants can create a better connection with those who are remote while remote attendees can more easily see who's speaking in the room. Combined with Front Row, remote participants can be seen just as clearly as those in the room. By using the "raise hands" reaction, in-room (via both Front Row and their individual devices) and remote participants can easily see those who want to contribute to the conversation.

### See and listen

To support this principle, all recipients can join the meeting in Teams (even if in the room) and see participant videos, reactions, chat, meeting content, live closed captioning, and who's the active speaker.

### Collaborate
