# Create a great Teams meeting experience for all participants

Meetings are a place where people come together to exchange ideas and work on hard problems. In a time when workplace environments are undergoing significant change, it can be challenging to bring people together and enable effective meetings. This solution shows you how can bring together Microsoft Teams, Teams Rooms devices, room design, meeting principles, and business practices, to create an inclusive meeting environment. An inclusive environment enables communication and collaboration between all recipients, regardless of whether they're in the room, remote, or have a disability.

The following sections outline the key steps in this scenario.

## Meeting principles

No matter what technology you use, meeting principles are at the core of inclusive meetings. These principles define how participants of a meeting interact with each other, how information is shared, and how to enable effective collaboration. Use the following principles as the basis for the principles you define for your organization. Review your principles with leaders and individual contributors, in-person and remote, with and without disabilities, across your organization.

Each of these principles helps define the meeting best practices outlined in [Step 2 - Evangelize meeting best practices](hybrid-meetings-educate-remote.md).

### Equality and inclusivity

All participants, whether in-person or remote, expect and deserve to be heard and to be given a chance to participate in collaboration. Participants with disabilities need access to technology and materials that enable them to fully participate in meetings.

The following Teams features can help support this principle:

* Teams chat for side conversations
* Front Row to view participants in other locations
* Meeting transcripts, live closed captioning, and recordings, for participants with disabilities

### Be seen and heard

All participants, but particularly those who are remote, should feel empowered to make their presence known in meetings and contribute to conversations.

The following Teams features can help support this principle:

* In-room companion join so in-room participants can contribute to meeting chat, use reactions, and so on, on their device
* Camera support, including for those in-room, so participants can show their presence and reactions to others
* "Raise hands" reaction so participants can indicate they want to contribute to a discussion
* Reactions to show sentiment for content and discussions

### See and listen

All participants, but particularly those who are in-person, should ensure that opportunities are made so that anyone who wants to contribute to a conversation, can.

The following Teams features can help support this principle:

* In-room companion join so in-room participants can follow meeting chat, use reactions, and so on, on their device
* Front Row so those in-room can see remote participants easily
* Live closed captioning for participants with disabilities
* "Raise hands" reaction so all participants can see who wants to contribute to the conversation
* Reactions to see sentiment for content and discussions

### Collaborate

All participants should endeavor to use virtual collaboration tools to ensure everyone is able to contribute to discussions.

The following Teams features can help support this principle:

* Breakout rooms for separate group-focused discussions
* Content sharing from devices
* Virtual whiteboards for seamless brainstorming
* Meeting chats for side discussions of content being presented
* Shared notes to keep track of meeting minutes and actions

### Request and provide feedback

Open and honest communication between meeting organizers and participants, both during and after a meeting, is critical to successful meetings.

* Meeting chats to make organizers and participants aware of issues in-meeting
* "Raise hands" action to get the attention of organizers or presenters
* Post-meeting surveys to send detailed feedback after the meeting has ended

## Step 1 - Get familiar with Teams meeting features

This step helps you understand what features are available in Teams to help make meetings more inclusive and effective.

## Step 2 - Evangelize meeting best practices

Meetings of the past were typically held in conference rooms with remote participants periodically calling in via a conference phone. Conversations were primarily between those in the room with remote participants listening in. If meetings were online, content may be shared with remote participants, but discussions were still heavily dominated by those in the room. There was a significant imbalance between remote and in-room participants.

Equality and inclusivity in meetings means ensuring that all participants, regardless of location or ability, are able to contribute to meetings. Do to this, all participants whether they're organizers, presenters, remote, or in the room, need to be aware how they "come to the meeting" and interact with others. This step provides best practices for each of these groups to help them become better participants.

## Step 3 - Design or enhance a meeting space

You might be looking to create a new meeting space, or just enhance an existing one. This step helps you design a meeting space that will support meetings with approximately 6-10 in-room participants and any number of remote participants. Things like what furniture is best and where it should be placed to support participants and the devices you want to use.

## Step 4 - Select devices for your space

Choosing the right devices for your space can be a little overwhelming because of the options available to you. This step steps you through the process of selecting the right devices to meet the needs of your space and participants.

## Step 5 - Build your meeting space

After you've designed your space and selected your devices, it's time to put everything together. This step helps you decide where your devices and furniture should be placed to give you and your participants a great meeting experience.

## Step 6 - Set up your devices

After you've built out your space, you need to set up your devices. This step helps you configure your devices and get your space ready for its first meeting.

## Step 7 - Manage and monitor your space and its devices

After everything's set up, you need to set up policies for how the meeting space and its devices should be used, and set up monitoring so that you can stay on top of device health and meeting experiences. This step helps you configure meeting and device policies and shows you how to use Teams monitoring tools to monitor call quality.
