# Configure Operator Connect

>[!NOTE]
>Operator Connect is currently available only in **public preview**. Public preview allows you to test upcoming features and provide feedback. Features included in public preview may not be complete, may undergo changes, and are not supported in Office 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC).

This article describes how to configure Operator Connect. Before configuring Operator Connect, be sure to read [Plan for Operator Connect](operator-connect-plan.md) for information about prerequisites and licensing.

You can enable, edit, and remove operators in the Teams Admin Center. In the left navigation pane, go to **Voice > Operators**.

## Enable an operator

To enable an operator:

1. **Choose an operator.** In the **All operators** tab, filter available operators by region or service to find the right operator for your voice needs. Then select the operator you want to enable.  

2. **Select countries.** Under **Operator settings**, select the countries you want to enable with your selected operator.

3. **Provide contact information.** Operators may want to contact you to share [commercial or business-related information]. To opt in, check the box and provide your contact information.  

4. **Accept the data transfer notice.**

## Set up phone numbers

How you set up phone numbers depends on whether you are setting up numbers for new users, or moving existing numbers from either Microsoft Calling Plans or Direct Routing.

- If you need to acquire phone numbers for new users, see [Acquire numbers for new Teams users](#acquire-numbers-for-new-teams-users).

- If you want to move existing numbers from Calling Plans to Operator Connect, see [Move numbers from Calling Plans to Operator Connect](#move-numbers-from-calling-plans-to-operator-connect).
