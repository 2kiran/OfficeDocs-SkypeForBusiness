# Microsoft Teams deployment overview

Hi! Thanks for choosing Microsoft Teams! Whether you're a five-person law firm, or a large multi-national distributor, Teams can help bring your organization together via chats, video meetings, file sharing, and more. And no matter whether you're just getting into collaboration tools for the first time, or if you're upgrading to Teams from Microsoft Skype for Business, we can help you get up and running.

Because Teams supports such a wide array of organization types and starting points, there are several options for setting it up. To help you find the information you need, we've split up some articles into two audiences: **Small business** (fewer than 50 users) and **Medium/large business** (more than 50 users). When reading an article, choose the audience tab that best matches your organization. Here's what the tabs look like:

The following is a list of sections you can choose from in the **Get started** section and a short description of each. 

> [!NOTE]
> The **Get started** section focuses on setting up Teams in an organization that doesn't already have a Skype for Business Online or on-premises Skype for Business deployment. If you have an existing Skype for Business deployment, see the following topics:
>
> - [Upgrade from Skype for Business](upgrade-start-here.md)
> - [Plan hybrid connectivity](../Skype/SfbHybrid/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity.md)

|Section  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Quick start     | The **Quick start** section introduces you to Teams in your own organization. You can start using features like teams, chats, file sharing, and more. If you're a small business, this might be all you need to roll out Teams to your employees. For larger businesses, use this section to start a pilot amongst your information technology group so you can get familiar with Teams.        |
