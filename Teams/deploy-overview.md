# Microsoft Teams deployment overview

Hi! Thanks for choosing Microsoft Teams! Whether you're a five-person law firm, or a large multi-national distributor, Teams can help bring your organization together via chats, video meetings, file sharing, and more. And no matter whether you're just getting into collaboration tools for the first time, or if you're upgrading to Teams from Microsoft Skype for Business, we can help you get up and running.

Because Teams supports such a wide array of organization types and starting points, there are several options for setting it up. To help you find the information you need, we've split up some articles into two audiences: **Small business** (fewer than 50 users) and **Medium/large business** (more than 50 users). When reading an article, choose the audience that best matches your organization.

#### [Small business](#tab/small)

This is small business content.

#### [Medium/large business](#tab/large)

This is medium/large business content.
