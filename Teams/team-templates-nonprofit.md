# Use nonprofit team templates

Team templates in Microsoft Teams allow you to quickly and easily create teams by providing a predefined team structure of settings, channels, and pre-installed apps.

For nonprofit organizations, team templates can be especially powerful, as they help you to quickly deploy consistent teams across your organization. Templates also help staff to get oriented with how to effectively use Teams.

Teams includes a Manage volunteers team template designed to streamline volunteer management activities. Use this pre-built template to quickly create teams for staff to communicate and collaborate on volunteer management tasks and activities.

In this article, you'll learn about the Manage volunteers team template and how to use it to create a team. This article also gives you an overview of how to manage team templates in the Teams admin center.

## Manage volunteers team template

Bring your staff together to communicate and collaborate on volunteer management tasks and activities.

This template includes channels and apps designed to streamline volunteer management activities. Staff can organize and share onboarding materials and frequently used documents, view reporting, stay up to date on important team and event announcements, and more. The template also integrates with Volunteer Management, an app that's part of Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit, enabling staff to manage volunteer engagement opportunities, without ever leaving Teams.

Here's the channels and apps that come with the Manage volunteers team template.

| Template type |TemplateId | Properties that come with this template |

You can duplicate this template but you can't edit it. If you want to change the properties in the template, [you can create a new team template from an existing one](create-template-from-existing-template.md), and then add or remove the properties that you want. Keep in mind that certain properties can't be changed.
