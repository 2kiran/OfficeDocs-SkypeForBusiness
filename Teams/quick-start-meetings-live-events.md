# Quick start - Meetings, webinars, and live events 

**QUESTIONS** to consider as you review:

- **TERMINOLOGY: DO WE CONSIDER WEBINARS AND LIVE EVENTS A TYPE OF MEETING?** I've done some research and many MVPs/customers are referring to webinars as a function of Teams meetings. Our UI also groups the three:  New Meeting ->  Schedule meeting, Webinar, Live event.

- **WHAT INFO DO WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE FIRST TABLE?**

- **ARE THE LIMITS SPECIFIED CORRECT?** Note: We might decide to point to the limits doc instead of repeating limits here, but for purposes of this review, let's agree on the limits.

- **WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF LARGE MEETING?  IS IT THE 1001 - 20,000 VIEW-ONLY CAPABILITY?**

- **ARE THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED CORRECT?**

- **IS THERE ANYWHERE THAT LISTS THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTIONALITY/CAPABILITIES BETWEEN MEETINGS, LARGE MEETINGS, WEBINARS, LIVE EVENTS?**

**BEGIN ARTICLE REVIEW**
-------------------------------------------

There are multiple ways to meet in Microsoft Teams: meetings, webinars, and live events. 

This article, intended for administrators and IT Pros, briefly describes the differences between meetings, webinars, and live events. It then provides links to the information you need to quickly roll out this functionality for your users.

> [!Note]
> For details about quickly configuring Teams meetings and events on different platforms, see [Teams features by platform](https://support.microsoft.com/office/teams-features-by-platform-debe7ff4-7db4-4138-b7d0-fcc276f392d3).

## Meetings, webinars, and live events

[Meetings](#meetings), [webinars](#webinars), and [live events](#live-events) are all types of meetings, but webinars and live events are a type of meeting that provide additional control for the organizer over the conversation and participants. Webinars provide two-way interaction while live events provide a managed Q&A experience. 

The different types of meetings also have different participant limits and participant capabilities. 

The following table briefly summarizes the three types of meetings, the number of recommended participants, and how participants can interact in the meeting. More information about each type of meeting follow the table.

**QUESTION:  WHAT INFO DO WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THIS TABLE? THIS TABLE SHOULD BE JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS--NOT ALL ENCOMPASSING.**

 | Type of meeting | Number of participants | Interaction | Registration supported |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Meetings  | -Up to 20,000* <br> | -Participants up to 1000 have fully interactive equal meeting capabilities <br> -Participants over 1000 up to 20,000 have [View-only](view-only-meeting-experience.md) capabilities  | No |

*The usual 10,000 is increased to 20,000 through December 31, 2021.<br>
**The usual 10,000 is increased to 20,000 through December 31, 2021. Note that you can schedule even greater numbers with Live Events through Yammer and/or Microsoft Stream. For more information, see [NEED LINK HERE].

For information about the view-only meeting experience, see [Teams view-only meeting experience](view-only-meeting-experience.md).

### Meetings

**Meetings** in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing for up to 1000 people. Participants don't need to be a member of an organization (or have a Teams account) to join a Teams meeting. They can join directly from the calendar invitation via the Join meeting link or call in via audio if available.  

As the administrator, you'll configure [meeting settings](meeting-settings-in-teams.md) for everyone. To control which meeting features are enabled for your organization, you'll use [meeting policies](meeting-policies-in-teams.md).


#### Considerations for administrators

The following lists key considerations...  including

[Manage your organization's devices](device-management.md), such as phones and Teams Rooms

### Webinars

**Webinars** are structured meetings where presenters and participants have clear roles. A key difference between webinars and Teams meetings is that webinars support registration and provide attendee engagement data.

## License requirements for meetings, webinars, and live events

Anyone can attend a Teams meeting, webinar, or live event for free -- no license is required. 

For the people who organize, schedule, and host meetings, webinars, or live events, they'll need one of the Microsoft 365 licenses listed in the [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description). If you're already using Teams, you probably have the license you need for organizing and hosting meetings, webinars, and live events.

To allow people to dial in to a meeting by phone, you'll need to set up audio conferencing. For more information about audio conferencing, see [Audio conferencing in Teams](deploy-audio-conferencing-teams-landing-page.md).
