# Quick start - Meetings, webinars, and live events in Microsoft Teams

**QUESTIONS** to consider as you review:

- **TERMINOLOGY: DO WE CONSIDER WEBINARS AND LIVE EVENTS A TYPE OF MEETING?** I've done some research and many MVPs/customers are referring to webinars as a function of Teams meetings. Our UI also groups the three:  New Meeting ->  Schedule meeting, Webinar, Live event.

- **WHAT INFO DO WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE FIRST TABLE?**

- **ARE THE LIMITS SPECIFIED CORRECT?** Note: We might decide to point to the limits doc instead of repeating limits here, but for purposes of this review, let's agree on the limits.

- **WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF LARGE MEETING?  IS IT THE 1001 - 20,000 VIEW-ONLY CAPABILITY?**

- **ARE THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED CORRECT?**

- **IS THERE ANYWHERE THAT LISTS THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTIONALITY/CAPABILITIES BETWEEN MEETINGS, LARGE MEETINGS, WEBINARS, LIVE EVENTS?**

**BEGIN ARTICLE REVIEW**
-------------------------------------------

There are multiple ways to meet in Microsoft Teams: meetings, webinars, and live events. 

This article, intended for administrators and IT Pros, briefly describes the differences between meetings, webinars, and live events. It then provides links to the information you need to quickly roll out this functionality for your users.

> [!Note]
> For details about quickly configuring Teams meetings and events on different platforms, see [Teams features by platform](https://support.microsoft.com/office/teams-features-by-platform-debe7ff4-7db4-4138-b7d0-fcc276f392d3).

## Meetings, webinars, and live events

[Meetings](#meetings), [webinars](#webinars), and [live events](#live-events) are all types of meetings, but webinars and live events are a type of meeting that provide additional control for the organizer over the conversation and participants. 

While webinars provide for more participant interaction than live events, both have limited interaction compared to a fully-interactive meeting. The different types of meetings also have different participant limits and participant capabilities.

The following table briefly summarizes the three types of events, the number of recommended participants, and how participants can interact in the event. More information about each type of event follow the table.

**QUESTION:  WHAT INFO DO WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THIS TABLE? THIS TABLE SHOULD BE JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS--NOT ALL ENCOMPASSING.**

 | Type of event | Number of participants | Interaction | Registration supported |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Meetings  | -Up to 1000 <br> -[View-only](view-only-meeting-experience.md) allows up to 20,000* | -Interactive chat with multiple presenters <br> -All participants up to 1000 have equal meeting capabilities <br> -Over 1000 have [View-only](view-only-meeting-experience.md) capabilities  | No |
| Webinars | Up to 20,000* |-Interactive up to 1000 <br> -View only from 1000-20,000 <br> -Audience interaction configurable, but limited <br> -Can specify presenters and moderators | Yes |
| Live events | 1001 to 20,000** |-Broadcast to large audiences <br>-Audience interaction limited to posting questions <br> -Can specify presenters, including external presenters | No |
||||

*The usual 10,000 is increased to 20,000 during COVID.<br>
**The usual 10,000 is increased to 20,000 during COVID. Note that you can schedule even greater numbers with Live Events through Yammer and/or Microsoft Stream. For more information, see [NEED LINK HERE].

### Meetings

**Meetings** in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing for up to 1000 people. They're one of the key ways to collaborate in Teams. And participants don't need to be a member of an organization (or even have a Teams account) to join a Teams meeting--all they need to do is look in the invitation for instructions about calling in.

As the administrator, you'll configure [meeting settings](meeting-settings-in-teams.md) for everyone. Then you'll use [meeting policies](meeting-policies-in-teams.md) to control what meeting features are and aren't available for your users.

To learn about managing meeting recording, read [Teams cloud meeting recording](cloud-recording.md).

If your users are new to Teams meetings, share the [Manage meetings](https://support.office.com/article/join-a-teams-meeting-078e9868-f1aa-4414-8bb9-ee88e9236ee4) training with them. Check out our instructor-led online class, [Run effective meetings with Teams](https://microsoftteams.eventbuilder.com/MaximizingTeamsMeetings). To learn about managing meeting options, read [Change participant settings for a Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/article/change-participant-settings-for-a-teams-meeting-53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e).

Don't forget about [managing your users' devices](./devices/device-management.md) - phones, headsets, cameras. To get the latest and up-to-date information on Teams certified devices, go to [Teams devices](https://office.com/teamsdevices).

For information about the view-only meeting experience, see [Teams view-only meeting experience](view-only-meeting-experience.md).


### Webinars

**Webinars** are structured meetings where presenters and participants have clear roles. Webinars are often used for training purposes or sales and marketing presentation scenarios. A key difference is that webinars support registration.

After setting up webinars in your organization, your users can schedule webinars and open registration to attendees. For more information about user capabilities, see [Get started with Teams webinars](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-teams-webinars-42f3f874-22dc-4289-b53f-bbc1a69013e3). 

For more information about how to set up webinars, see [Set up webinars in Teams](set-up-webinars.md). With webinars, you can configure your meeting to be interactive to the first 1000 users, but view only for the remaining users up to 20,000.   **IS THE LAST SENTENCE TRUE?**

### Live events

**Live events** are structured meetings that enable your organizatiaon to schedule and produce events that stream to large online audiences - up to 20,000 people. If you need a meeting with broadcast capabilities only for more than 1000 people, use a live event. With live events, audience participation is limited to posting questions.

If you're new to live events, for more information, see [What are Teams live events?](teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events.md) and [Plan for Teams live events](teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events.md).

As the administrator, you [configure live events](teams-live-events/configure-teams-live-events.md) for everyone. You then set up and assign [live event policies](teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events.md) to control what your users can and can't do.

Make sure your live event producers and organizers are trained. For training, your users should see  [Get started with live events](https://support.office.com/article/get-started-with-microsoft-teams-live-events-d077fec2-a058-483e-9ab5-1494afda578a).


## License requirements for meetings, webinars, and live events

Anyone can attend a Teams meeting, webinar, or live event for free -- no license is required. 

For the people who will organize, schedule, and host meetings, webinars, or live events, they'll need one of the Microsoft 365 licenses listed in the table below. If you're already using Teams, you probably have the license you need for organizing and hosting meetings, webinars, and live events.

Meeting audio is part of a Teams meeting, but if you want people to be able to dial in to a meeting by phone, you'll need to provide a dial-in number, which requires setting up audio conferencing. For more information about audio conferencing, see [Audio conferencing in Teams](deploy-audio-conferencing-teams-landing-page.md).
