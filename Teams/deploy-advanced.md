# Teams advanced setup

If you're a medium or large business, you need to think about how you're going to roll out the service to your users, how you're going to deploy the Microsoft Teams client to them, how your network design could impact the quality of real-time communication, and so on.

## Architecture

Teams is tightly integrated into Microsoft 365 and uses many features to power chat, file sharing, meetings, telephony, video streaming, and more. 

## Teams advisor

(You must be a [Microsoft 365 global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles) to open the Teams advisor)

## Adoption

To ensure that your organization and your users get the most out of Teams, you also need an adoption program. An effective adoption program can mobilize early adopters who can:

- Articulate the benefits of Teams to their colleagues and to business or group leaders.
- Spark excitement in others who see how Teams improves collaboration and makes it easier to connect with each other.
- Help evaluate existing business processes and make recommendations for how Teams can be integrated into them.
- Report back to the deployment team both successes and difficulties to help improve the adoption process.

For details about setting up an adoption program, see [Adopt Microsoft Teams](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).
