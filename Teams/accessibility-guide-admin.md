# Accessibility guide for Microsoft Teams Admins

As the Microsoft Teams administrator for your organization, you can help make your Teams environment as inclusive and accessible as possible for all your users. Follow the guides and resources below to configure Microsoft Teams for optimal accessibility.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the accessibility options are turned on by default but you can check that they weren’t turned off by following the guides below.

## Turn on captions and transcription for meetings and calls

Create inclusive meetings and calls for users with disabilities so everyone can participate and contribute. 

### Turn on live captions for meetings

Live captions are real-time auto-generated text of what is said in a meeting. They appear a few lines at a time for a user who has turned them on, and aren’t saved.

To turn on live captions for users:

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Meetings**, and then select the dropdown **Meeting policies**.

2. Select the policy you want to modify.
 
3. Go to the **Participants & guests** section.

4. Switch **Live captions** to **Not enabled but the user can override**.

5. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Live captions are available for meetings held in Commercial, and the U.S. Government Community Cloud (GCC) organizations.

### Turn on transcription for calls

Transcription is auto-generated, recorded text of what was said in a call. When turned on, the transcript is available to users to review after a call has ended.

To turn on transcription for users:

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice**, and then select the dropdown **Calling policies**.

2. Select the policy you want to modify.

3. Turn **Transcription** to **On**, then select **Save**.

### Why captions and transcripts are important

Captions and transcripts are text versions of the words someone is speaking. They give people the option to see text in addition to, or instead of, audio alone. Captions also benefit people who are deaf or hard of hearing by giving additional information on top of what some users receive from the sign language interpreter or CART captioner they might work with.

Captions and transcription are helpful in a wide variety of situations, but is especially helpful for:

- People who are deaf or hard of hearing

- People with learning disabilities
