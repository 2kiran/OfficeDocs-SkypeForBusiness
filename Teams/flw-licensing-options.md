# Understand frontline worker user types and licensing

Organizations in many industries, such as retail, manufacturing, hospitality, and more, have a mix of user types:

- Information workers, who probably have desktop or laptop computers, and likely work more on documents than directly with customers, such as headquarters staff.
- Frontline workers, who often work on tablets or phones, and work either directly with customers, such as factory workers, retail associates, healthcare clinicians and nursing staff, and so on.

Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams have features and a licensing model to support both types of users for your organization. [Microsoft 365 for Frontline Workers](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline) is optimized for a mobile workforce that primarily interacts with customers, but also needs to stay connected to the rest of your organization.

## Assign appropriate licenses to support frontline worker and information worker user types

If it makes sense for your organization, you can assign different licenses to these different types of users. The following illustration shows one way to apply licenses and policies for Retail workers, for example:

:::image type="content" source="./media/retail-license-options.png" alt-text="Mix license types to support the different roles in your organization. Use Enterprise licenses for your information workers, such as headquarters staff, and Frontline Worker licenses for mobile workers, such as store managers, sales associates, shipping staff, stockers, and pickers.":::

With this example, you can mix license types for the two types of workers in your organization, like in the following table:

| Information workers have an Enterprise license and can: | Frontline workers have a Frontline Worker license and can: |
| ----- | ----- |
| Use full Office apps on desktops or laptops, as well as mobile apps on phones and tablets | Use mobile apps on phones or tablets (not desktops or laptops) |
| Use all Teams functionality (depending on the specific license) | Use Teams to: chat, meet, see notifications, use Lists, use Shifts and store documents |
| Use all included Microsoft 365 services (depending on the specific license) | Use SharePoint, OneDrive, Yammer, Stream |

For a detailed comparison of what's included in Microsoft 365 with various licenses, see this [Comparison table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139145).

Of course, for simplicity, or if your workers all need access to the full capabilities of Microsoft 365, you can use the same Enterprise license for all of your worker types, and still target capabilities to different user roles using Teams policy packages, such as the Frontline Worker [policy package](../manage-policy-packages.md).
