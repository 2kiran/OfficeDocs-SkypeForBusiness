# Manage apps with policies

App policies are used to control applications in Microsoft Teams.

* App permission policies are used to control what apps are available to your users. As an admin, you can allow or block specific apps that your users install from the Teams app store. [App permission policies](teams-app-permission-policies.md) are managed through the Microsoft Teams admin center.
* Setup policies enable you to pin and install applications on behalf on your users and control these settings for your organization. [App setup policies](teams-app-setup-policies.md) are managed in the Teams admin center.
* Control who can upload custom apps to Teams with custom app policies. [Custom app settings and policies](teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings.md) are managed through the Microsoft Teams admin center.
