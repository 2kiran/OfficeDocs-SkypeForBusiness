# Teams Essentials QuickStart guide for small businesses

Microsoft Teams Essentials is a new subscription plan for small and medium-sized businesses. As your business adapts to the increased need for virtual connections and remote working, you can use Teams Essentials to securely collaborate with employees, partners, suppliers, and customers. Whether you're a multi-city bakery, or a nine-person event agency, Microsoft Teams Essentials can bring your business together through a connected experience with online meetings, chats, and seamless collaboration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is for small and medium-sized businesses using a Microsoft Teams Essentials subscription plan **purchased directly from  [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options)** and doesn't apply to Teams Essentials managed through a [Cloud Solution Provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider/find-a-provider).

### Getting started with Microsoft Teams Essentials

Is your business new to Microsoft Teams? Thanks for choosing Microsoft! 

To get started with Teams Essentials, follow these steps:

1. **Purchase the subscription.** Go to [Microsoft Teams Essentials for small business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/free) and select **Buy now** under Microsoft Teams Essentials.
2. **Sign up with your existing email address.** Use an existing email address and follow the instructions to purchase user licenses.
3. **Review Teams service description.** Visit [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description) to learn more about Microsoft Teams.

When you've completed these tasks, you're ready to plan, deploy, and use the Teams app.

To do that, complete these three steps:

1.  **Install the Teams app.** Install the Teams client on your PC or mobile device by going here: [Download Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app).

2. **Get Familiar with Teams.** The best way to become familiar with Teams is to start using it right away. Take some time to explore the application so you have a better understanding of its capabilities.

3. **Plan for adoption.** For small businesses, planning for user adoption can be as simple as individually showing your users how to use Teams. Often, small business customers don't consider this step for new applications, which negatively affects the application's success and adoption.

3.  **Manage Teams Essentials.** Similar to the free version of Microsoft Teams, you have a limited admin role as the first person to sign up for Teams Essentials in your organization. You can add and remove team members and specify whether anyone can invite another members with this role, but you won't have  advanced administrative capabilities or access to the Microsoft Teams admin center.

## How does Microsoft Teams Essentials compare to other Microsoft Teams plans?

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> To get enhanced administration and entire full set of Teams features, you'll need to upgrade to the full version of Teams by purchasing an appropriate [Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options) for your users. We recommend this as you'll have more flexibility to manage the way your organization collaborates.

### Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams Essentials

Here are a few important Teams Essentials limits and specifications to consider:
  - **Administration:** A Teams Essentials subscription **does not** come with access to the Teams Admin Center. Teams Essentials users can enjoy a simplified view of the Microsoft 365 admin center to conduct important tasks like,managing  subscriptions and configuring new users.

  - **Microsoft Teams PowerShell:** You **cannot** manage Teams Essentials directly using PowerShell command line as there is no PowerShell support.

  - **Storage**: Teams Essentials uses OneDrive's personal cloud storage for file storage.


## Upgrade from a free version of Microsoft Teams to Microsoft Teams Essentials

If your organization is using a free version of Microsoft Teams, you can easily upgrade to the Teams Essentials version by purchasing a plan for your users directly in Teams.

#### Upgrade Requirements

You can upgrade to Microsoft Teams Essentials if you're the person who signed up for the existing Teams free subscription. In Microsoft Teams free, the first person who signed up for Teams in your organization has a limited admin role.

> [!NOTE]
> To upgrade and transfer your data, you have to buy your subscription through the Teams application [upgrade process](#how-do-i-upgrade-my-organization) outlined in this section.

#### How do I upgrade my organization?

Before you upgrade, you'll need to determine what version of Microsoft Teams free your organization is currently running. You can find this information by going into Teams and selecting your name icon from the top navigation bar. Once your name is selected, a drop down menu will appear with your version of Teams free highlighted at the top.

![screenshot showing Upgrade button.](media/teams-freemium-upgrade-image1.png)

To upgrade to the Microsoft Teams Essentials version of Teams, select the **Upgrade** button at the bottom of the drop down menu. Next, continue on to the steps for your specific version of Microsoft Teams free later in this section.

##### Teams free (classic)

After selecting the **Upgrade** button in Teams, you'll be directed here: [Compare Microsoft Teams Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options)

##### Teams free

After selecting the **Upgrade** button in Teams, you'll be directed here: [Microsoft Teams for Small Business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/upgrade)

Enter the current email address you use to sign into Teams, and then purchase the Microsoft Teams Essentials plan.

#### Limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind:

- You can't switch back to Teams free (classic) or Teams free after you upgrade.

- You can't merge multiple Teams free (classic) or Teams free tenants into a single paid tenant.

- All users must be in the same domain. (All users will get a login in the format *username*@*domain.com*.)

- All users must be upgraded: a mix of Teams free (classic), Teams free, and paid subscription users in the same tenant isn't supported.
