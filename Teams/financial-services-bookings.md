# Virtual consultations with Teams and the Bookings app for remote sales and service

## Overview

The [Bookings app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5) in Microsoft Teams streamlines and simplifies remote sales and service for financial services organizations. You can schedule and manage virtual consultations, enabling bank relationship managers, financial advisors, and claims adjusters, just to name a few, to serve your customers with increased efficiency and convenience.

The Bookings app makes it easy to manage complex scheduling demands across your organization. Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well as communications with internal and external attendees, from a single experience.

Virtual consultations are held through Microsoft Teams meetings, which offers robust videoconferencing capabilities. For example, a banking advisor can share their screen and request electronic signatures on documents, allowing them to close transactions remotely.

Each virtual appointment includes a Teams meeting link that’s sent to attendees in email where they can easily join from a web browser or in Teams on any device. Automated email reminders help reduce no-shows and enhance customer engagement.

And with the Microsoft Bookings web app, you can publish an online booking page where your customers can see available booking times, giving them the flexibility to schedule a consultation at a time that works best for them. ???After you set up your booking page, your day-to-day scheduling can be done through the Bookings app in Teams.

???How to fold in setup tasks in Microsoft Bookings (logo, service options, scheduling policies, buffer times etc) that aren't supported in the Bookings app in Teams?

This article gives you an overview of how to use the Bookings app in Teams to deliver remote sales and service.

## Before you get started

If you’re an admin, see [Virtual visits with Teams and the Bookings app](bookings-app-admin.md) to learn about the prerequisites for using the Bookings app in Teams, how to control access to Bookings in your organization, and recommended policy and admin settings.

## Set up a new booking calendar

### Create the booking calendar

In Teams, go to **Bookings** > **Get started**, and then select **New booking calendar**. Complete the form and be sure to choose **Financial services** for the business type.

If you’re a larger organization, consider creating more than one booking calendar if you want customers to receive a booking email from a specific department rather than your overall organization. 
To learn more, see [Create a booking calendar](https://support.microsoft.com//office/create-a-bookings-calendar-921cfd26-a24d-4aca-9004-561594112148).

### Add staff

In the booking calendar, go to **More options** > **Settings**, and then select **Staff**. Add staff members and assign a role to each person you add.

The Bookings app syncs with Outlook. After you add staff, you’ll be able to view that person’s calendar availability and schedule bookings for them. To learn more, see [Add staff and view a booking calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-staff-and-view-a-bookings-calendar-6c579f61-8adb-4514-9458-021de2023fa0).  

### Create appointment types

Create appointment types to represent the services offered by your organization and to tailor the booking experience.

In the booking calendar, go to **More options** > **Settings** > **Appointment types**, and then select **New appointment type**. Enter a name&mdash;for example, Account opening, Loan consultation, Tax preparation&mdash;and any other information and settings you want.

The information and links that you include are emailed to customers every time this type of appointment is booked. You can even set email reminders and whether customers can join from a mobile browser, without having to download Teams. To learn more, see [Create an appointment type](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-an-appointment-type-810eac77-6a65-4dc8-964d-c00eadf43887).
