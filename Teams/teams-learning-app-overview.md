Install, manage, and assign permissions for the Teams Learning app (private preview)
====================================================================================

*This article contains preliminary content for the Teams Learning app, which is in private preview.*

The Microsoft Teams Learning app (private preview) empowers teams and individuals to make learning a natural part of their day. The app creates a central hub in Teams where employees can share, assign, and learn from content libraries across your organization.  Admins set permissions and allow content for the Learning app (private preview), including LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, Microsoft 365 training, your organization's own content stored in SharePoint online, and third-party providers that are supported by the application.

To set up the Teams Learning app (private preview), you will need to involve:

-	Teams admin center admin
-	Microsoft 365 admin center admin
-	Knowledge admin (a new role in the Microsoft 365 admin center that can be assigned to a user in your organization to set up and manage the learning sources in the Microsoft 365 admin center)

## Configure the Teams Learning app (private preview) in the Teams admin center
