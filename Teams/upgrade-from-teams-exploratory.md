# Upgrade from Teams Exploratory trial 

This article provides an overview of how to upgrade your users from a Teams Exploratory trial to a paid subscription to Teams.

## Step 1: When to upgrade  

To check when your organization’s Teams Exploratory trial is expiring and how many active users it has, go to **Billing >** <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank"><b>Your products</b></a> in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You’ll also be notified before the Teams Exploratory trial expires.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should upgrade to a paid license before the end of the 30-day grace period, so users don’t lose access to Teams. 
>
> After the expiration date, users have access to Teams for a 30-day grace period. As long as users are assigned a paid license within 60 days of the expiration date, they can regain access to Teams and all content still exists. However, after 60 days, the users’ data is deleted. For more information, see What happens to my data and access when my subscription ends? After a new license is assigned to the users to enable Teams functionality again, if they are added within the grace period time frame, all content remains.

## Step 2: Choose an upgrade path

Depending on the subscriptions your organization currently has, there are three ways to upgrade from a Microsoft Teams Exploratory trial to a paid license:

- **Upgrade an existing Microsoft 365 subscription.** Use this option if your organization has subscriptions to other Office products that don’t include Teams. For more information, see Upgrade to a different business plan | Microsoft Docs  for more information.  To see active users for an existing subscription, go to Users > Active users in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Add users to an existing Microsoft 365 subscription.** Use this option if your organization doesn’t have enough paid Teams licenses to cover the Teams Exploratory users. For more information, see Buy or remove licenses | Microsoft Docs. To add users to an existing subscription that already has enough available licenses, see Move users to a different subscription | Microsoft Docs.  To see active users for an existing subscription, go to Users > Active users in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Buy a new Microsoft 365 subscription.** Use this option if your organization doesn’t have any existing subscriptions to Office products, or if your organization wants to buy a subscription that’s different from their existing subscription to cover Teams Exploratory users.  For more information, see Buy a different Microsoft 365 for business subscription | Microsoft Docs

If you’re not sure which M365 subscription to upgrade to, see Compare All Microsoft 365 Plans | Microsoft  for more information. If you need additional help choosing a subscription, or if your organization needs more than 300 licenses, contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft account representative. 

## Step 3: Assign paid licenses

> [!NOTE]
> Before you unassign any Teams Exploratory licenses, assign new licenses to all the users you’re upgrading. Otherwise, they lose access to Teams until you assign a paid license.  

To assign your newly-acquired licenses, see Assign licenses to users - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Docs.  

After you assign the new licenses, unassign the Teams Exploratory licenses. See Unassign licenses from users - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Docs, for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> Next time you upgrade, use auto-claim policies to create policies for your organization to automatically assign licenses from paid subscriptions to new users who haven’t acquired a Teams license. See Manage auto-claim policies | Microsoft Docs for more information.
