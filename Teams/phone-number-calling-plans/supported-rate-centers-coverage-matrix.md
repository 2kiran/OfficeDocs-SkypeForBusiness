# Supported rate centers and coverage for Calling Plans

This article lists the supported rate centers and coverage for Calling Plans. A rate center is a geographical area that's used to determine boundaries for calling, billing rates, and assigning phone numbers for the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

Use this information when you're getting new phone numbers for your organization. Download the spreadsheet for your country or region and use it to search for rate centers. Do not use this for area codes (NPA) or prefixes (NXX).
